  <h2 class='c006'>The Maxim Gun.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Weight of the ·303-in. gun, 60 lbs. Weight of the
tripod, 48 lbs. Weight of ammunition box containing one
filled belt, Mark VI 21 lbs., Mark VII 19½ lbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun may be considered as divided into two portions—the
non-recoiling and the recoiling. It is worked
automatically by two forces—the explosion of the charge
which forces the recoiling portion backwards, and a strong
spring (called the fusee spring) which carries it forward.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Non-Recoiling Portion.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The non-recoiling portion consists of the barrel casing
and breech casing, and is attached to the mounting by the
crosshead and elevating joint pins.</p>

<p class='c005'>The barrel casing is of gunmetal, holding about seven
pints of water to keep the barrel cool when firing; it has
three openings, one on the upper right side near the breech
for filling, one underneath near the muzzle for drawing off
the water, and the third (also near the muzzle) for allowing
the steam, but not the water, to escape. The first two
are closed with screwed plugs; the last is open and
connected with the steam tube, and carries the condenser
nipple.</p>

<p class='c005'>A cork plug is provided which can be inserted in the
steam escape hole when the gun is travelling, in order to
prevent waste of water from jolting. The plug should
always be taken out before commencing to fire, and put in
again before the gun changes position, unless the condenser
is attached to the barrel casing and can be conveniently
moved with the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>To prevent the escape of water, there is at the forward
end of the barrel casing asbestos packing, which is held in
position round the barrel by the packing gland. At the
rear end of the barrel there is a cannelure, also filled with
asbestos packing, which prevents the escape of water when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the gun is working, and a gunmetal valve immediately in
front of the barrel block, which prevents the escape of
water when the gun is not firing and the barrel home.</p>

<p class='c005'>The steam tube consists of a fixed tube and an outer
tube, termed the slide valve, so arranged as to slide freely
along the fixed tube. In the fixed tube there is a hole near
each end, and a third hole in the threaded portion in front,
to connect with the steam escape hole which is bored in the
solid part of the front end of the barrel casing. This tube
is fixed into the solid end of the barrel casing, and is
retained in position by a screw which, being kept in adjustment
by a keeper screw, ensures that the third hole coincides
with the steam escape hole. At the breech end it
fits into a recess.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the gun is fired with elevation, the valve slides backwards,
and, closing up the hole at the rear end of the tube,
prevents the water entering; at the same time it leaves the
front hole uncovered, which, being above the water level,
allows the steam to enter the tube and escape through
the steam escape hole in the barrel casing. Similarly,
if the gun is fired with depression, the valve slides forward
and allows the steam, but not the water, to escape through
the rear hole.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the lower part of the barrel casing is the ejector tube
through which the empty cartridge cases are ejected from
the gun. The tube is fitted with a spring, which prevents
the cases falling backwards into the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>The breech casing consists of two outside plates, a bottom
plate which is riveted to them, and the rear cross piece, the
whole being closed by a cover.</p>

<p class='c005'>The outside plates are dovetailed into the barrel casing,
and, together with the cover, are secured by means of a
cover joint pin.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the outside of the right hand plate there are the
following fittings:—(1) a socket and stud for securing and
supporting the buffer spring; (2) the resistance piece, and
(3) the stud for the check lever. On the outside of the left
hand plate are three studs for holding the fusee spring
box, the rear one being on the slide mentioned below;
there are also two other studs on this plate for fixing a
shoulder piece to the gun if required. In both plates are
slots partly closed by slides, in which the crank bearings
move, and on the inside of both plates are solid cams
which control the path of the extractor. Below these, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>supporting the side plates, are rests, along which the recoiling
portion travels.</p>

<p class='c005'>Along the bottom plate lies the trigger bar, and underneath
is a bracket to which the elevating gear is attached
by means of the elevating joint pin.</p>

<p class='c005'>The outside plates are connected at the rear end by the
rear cross piece, into which they both dovetail; this piece
is fitted with (1) hollow handles, which are also used for
carrying oil, and are closed by milled heads, fitted with
camel-hair brushes; (2) a firing lever and spring, the lower
end of which fits into the trigger bar, while the upper end
is provided with a double button for firing; (3) an automatic
double-handed safety catch, which is so arranged
that unless it is held up the firing lever cannot be pressed
forward; and (4) a pivoted shutter, which, when moved to
the right or left, uncovers an aperture through which
(when the lock is removed and the crank handle vertical)
the barrel can be inspected or cleaned from the rear.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cover is fitted with (1) springs to ensure the extractor
dropping on recoil; (2) a gunmetal block to keep the lock
down when back, and (3) at the rear end, a lock to fasten
it. On the upper surface is the tangent sight, consisting of
a stem, a graduated plate and slide. Running through the
centre of the slide is a pinion, the teeth of which work in
the rack on the stem. A pawl is secured to the pinion by
a fixing pin. On the under side of one end of the pawl are
teeth, which engage in the circular rack on the slide.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the slide is at rest the stud on the inside of the
milled head (nearest the slot for the slide spring) bears on
the stud on the pawl immediately over the teeth, being
actuated by the slide spring, thus forcing the teeth into
the circular rack. This keeps the slide stationary on the
stem. On rotating the milled head, this stud is partly
disengaged from the stud on the pawl, thus permitting a
second stud on the milled head to press on one side of the
V-shaped ramp at the other end of the pawl. This action
releases the teeth sufficiently to permit the pawl being
moved round the circular rack by the action of the stud
bearing on one side of the V-shaped ramp on the pawl;
this moves the slide along the stem. On releasing the
milled head, the spring positions the cover, thus causing the
stud on the pawl to become once more engaged with
the stud on the milled head and force the teeth into the
rack.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Recoiling Portion.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The recoiling portion (which is mounted inside the
non-recoiling portion) consists of a barrel and two side
plates which carry the lock and the crank.</p>

<p class='c005'>The barrel is coated with copper to protect it from rust;
the gunmetal valve referred to above, which prevents the
escape of water to the rear, is fitted just in front of the
breech end, which is formed in the shape of a block;
this block has two studs, one on each side, called the barrel
trunnions, by means of which the barrel is attached to the
side plates.</p>

<p class='c005'>The side plates are each provided with a hole to receive
the barrel trunnions, and in the case of the ·303-in. gun,
with hooks for engaging the recesses on the top of the barrel
block; also guides in which the flanges of the lock move,
which are enlarged at the rear end to act as crank stops;
in addition each has a bearing, through which the crank
passes, thus connecting the latter with the barrel; these
bearings move in slots in the breech casing. The left side
plate is fitted with a connecting rod spring to hold the
connecting rod upright when the lock is removed, and the
right side plate is fitted with a side plate spring near the
barrel, to keep the extractor in its highest position when
the lock is home. The left side plate is prolonged to the
front, and has a recess in which the bottom lever of the
feed block engages.</p>

<p class='c005'>The crank is fitted with a connecting rod, which is free
to rotate on the crank pin, and, outside the breech casing
on the right, with a handle which has a curved projecting
arm, and on the left with a fusee, to which is attached a
chain.</p>

<p class='c005'>The connecting rod is attached to the crank by means of
an axis pin, called the crank pin, and is arranged to take
the lock by means of an interrupted screw, thereby connecting
the crank and the lock. The connecting rod is
divided into two parts, enabling its length to be increased by
inserting washers of varying thicknesses. By this means
it is ensured that a firm pressure is kept on the base of the
cartridge at the moment of firing, thus preventing separations.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the left of the breech casing there is a strong spiral
spring, called the fusee spring, the rear end of which is
connected by the fusee chain and fusee with the crank;
the front end is attached to the breech casing by means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of the fusee spring box and adjusting screw, which passes
through the front end of the fusee spring box, and through
the nut at the front end of the spring.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lock is attached to the connecting rod by the screwed
head, and when in the firing position closes the breech.
In this position it is held by the side levers, the crank (which
bears against stops on the side plates), and the connecting
rod, the joint being slightly above the horizontal, to
prevent the breech being opened at the moment of firing.
The lock has a reciprocating motion communicated to it
by the rotation of the crank, and is kept in position during
its backward and forward movements by means of flanges
working in guides on the side plates, and, when at the end
of its backward travel and clear of the guides, by the
gunmetal block underneath the cover.</p>

<p class='c005'>The extractor is moved upwards by means of the side and
extractor levers, and when in its highest position, is
retained there by means of the side plate spring; this
ensures the hole for the firing pin being opposite the centre
of the base of the cartridge when the lock is home. The
upward and downward movements of the extractor are
regulated by guide ribs and stops; the upper stop forms
part of the lock casing, and the lower one is removable.</p>

<p class='c005'>The feed block, which fits under the cover into a recess
cut in the breech casing, is provided with a slide to which
are attached two pawls with springs, for the purpose
of moving the cartridges from right to left; the slide has a
transverse motion given to it by means of two levers which
are fitted together; the top lever has a slot which engages
a stud on the slide, and on the bottom lever is a stud
which engages in a recess in the left side plate; by this
means the slide is connected with the recoiling portion.
The feed block has also two stationary pawls, which engage
under the belt and prevent it slipping backwards during
firing. To facilitate the entrance of the cartridges, the
feed block is provided with a band roller, and in addition
has steel guides fitted above and below in the cartridge
way, which ensure the cartridges coming to the exact
position where they can be gripped by the extractor;
they are prevented from being pushed too far through to
the left by means of the cartridge and bullet stops, which
are inside the feed block.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun is supplied with cartridges from a belt which
passes from right to left through the feed block. This belt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>is formed by two pieces of webbing connected together
by eyelets and brass strips of two lengths, the projecting
strips showing how far the cartridges should be inserted;
the belt is made thick at the edge next the bullets by being
folded over a piece of cord, so that the cartridges may be
kept parallel in passing through the feed block, and lie
evenly in the ammunition belt boxes.</p>

<p class='c005'>(Flexible steel belts are now being used. These fold
into their box in sections, and by withdrawing a pin the
unexpended portion can be detached and packed away
immediately. They appear to be giving considerable
satisfaction, inasmuch as “belt troubles” are practically
impossible.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Converted Guns.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Converted guns are the original ·45-in. guns made to
take the ·303-in. cartridge.</p>

<p class='c005'>The conversion consists in the substitution of ·303-in.
barrels for the ·45-in. barrels and the adaption of the
mechanism to the smaller calibre by the introduction of
new parts or the alteration of existing parts.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Mark II differs from the Mark I in being fitted with
the service ·303-in. barrel and muzzle attachment for ball
firing, whereas the Mark I has a special muzzle attachment
and a heavy barrel. The difference in the barrels affects
also certain other parts. In both Marks I and II converted
guns the attachment for ball firing must always be on the
guns, as, owing to the greater weight of the component
parts, these guns will not work without it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tangent sight is graduated to 2,500 yards.</p>

<p class='c005'>The weight is 64 lbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>In other respects they resemble the ·303-in. gun except
that the connecting rod is not above the horizontal and
that there is a space of about ⅒ of an inch between the
projecting arm of the crank handle and the resistance
piece.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Ammunition.</h4>

<p class='c014'>All marks of ·303-in. ball ammunition may be used, but
care should be taken to select ammunition of the most
recent manufacture. Mark VII can, however, be used only
in guns specially modified to take it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The mounting consists of a crosshead (<i>a</i>), elevating
gear (<i>b</i>), and socket (<i>c</i>), mounted on three legs.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is constructed to give 13 degrees elevation and 25
degrees depression at heights varying from 14½-in. to 30-in.
from the axis of the gun to the ground. By arranging the
position of the rear and front legs respectively, elevation
may be given up to about 43 degrees and depression to
55 degrees. An all-round traverse can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c005'>The crosshead (<i>a</i>), to which the gun is pivoted, is formed
with a pivot to fit into the socket (<i>c</i>) and an arm (<i>d</i>) which
carries the elevating gear (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p class='c005'>The elevating gear, which is actuated by a hand wheel (<i>v</i>),
consists of an inner and outer screw (right and left-handed)
and a nut working within a tumbler (<i>g</i>). The tumbler
is split and provided with a jamming bolt (<i>h</i>), by which the
wear may be taken up. The inner part of the screw is
attached to the crosshead by a chain. Chains also, for
future manufacture and replacement, will secure the joint
pins to the mounting.</p>

<p class='c005'>The socket (<i>c</i>) is bored to receive the crosshead and is
provided with three lugs (<i>n</i>), to which the legs are hinged;
a jamming block and screw with handle (<i>f</i>) is attached to
the front to secure the crosshead in any desired angle of
traverse; the block works in a recess in the upper portion
of the crosshead and prevents it from rising. Both
faces of the rear lug and one face of each front lug are
fitted with clutch plates having radial serrations to correspond
with similar serrations on the faces of the leg joints.
Joint studs with disc spring and jamming handle (<i>s</i>) are</p>

<h3 class='c016'>TO MOUNT AND DISMOUNT GUN.</h3>

<h4 class='c015'>To Mount Gun.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Machine gunner No. 1 will carry tripod into position,
elevating screws being equally exposed. Cross head
upright. Legs clamped tight.</p>

<p class='c005'>No. 2 will carry gun to right side of tripod, holding
rear cross piece with left hand, gun muzzle to rear under
right arm. Kneel on left knee, facing tripod, and supporting
weight of gun on right knee, place it on tripod,
pushing in and turning down the crosshead joint pin.
Remove cork plug finally from steam escape hole, No. 1
fixing elevating joint pin.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Dismount Gun.</h4>

<p class='c014'>No. 1 removes crosshead and elevating joint pins, No. 2
replaces cork plug and removes gun as in mounting,
carrying it to its original position in rear, No. 1 following
with the tripod. Joint pins will then be pushed home and
turned down, legs folded and clamped.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>TO LOAD AND UNLOAD GUN.</h3>

<h4 class='c015'>To Load.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Pass the tag of belt through feed block from right
side, turning crank handle with right hand on to buffer spring,
and pull belt through with left hand to left front
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>as far as it will go, let go crank handle, the first cartridge
will then be gripped by the extractor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again turn crank handle on to buffer spring, and pull
belt to left front, letting go crank handle—the gun is then
ready for firing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Make each motion clear and distinct.</p>

<p class='c005'>On pressing double button the gun will fire automatically
until pressure is released.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Unload.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Turn crank handle twice in succession on to buffer
spring, letting it fly back to the check lever each time.
Press up the bottom pawls and remove belt from feed
block, then release the lock spring by pressing double
button.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>TO CLEAN GUN.</h3>

<h4 class='c015'>Mechanism.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Equal parts of G.S. lubricating oil and paraffin should
be used, each part being thoroughly dried and slightly
oiled with G.S. lubricating oil.</p>

<p class='c005'>The various parts can easily be got at by “hanging”
the lock as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Turn the crank handle on to buffer spring, raise lock
slightly till clear of guides, allow handle to come back
a little, and lock to rest on top of guides, when it will
be fixed and easily accessible.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Barrel.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Turn crank handle over against buffer spring, open
cover, raise lock, and as the crank handle is allowed to
come slowly back raise it and let it rest upon the top of
the rear crosspiece.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cleaning rod may then be used from muzzle of
barrel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Daily cleaning is absolutely necessary for at least ten
days after using ball ammunition and the bore should at all
times be left coated with oil.</p>

<p class='c005'>(A double-ended pull through may be used to remove
hard fouling.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Treatment in Frosty Weather.</h4>

<p class='c014'>In frosty weather, when water is kept in the barrel
casing, a blanket or some other thick covering should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>kept wrapped round the barrel casing to prevent the water
freezing. The working parts of the gun should only be
slightly oiled with a lightly-oiled rag. In climates where
the temperature is likely to fall much below freezing point,
not more than about 5 pints of water should be put into
the barrel casing (25 per cent. of glycerine mixed with the
water will prevent it from freezing so quickly).</p>

<h3 class='c016'>MUZZLE ATTACHMENT.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The force of recoil is increased by the use of the muzzle
attachment. Defects in the working of the gun are overcome
by this means.</p>

<p class='c005'>It consists of a steel cylinder with a hole bored longitudinally
through it, the front end of cylinder being partially
closed by a screw. Gases escaping from the muzzle of
barrel are partially confined to the interior of attachment,
the pressure of the gas acting on the muzzle of barrel
giving additional recoil.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is fitted by unscrewing the packing gland from the
barrel casing, and screwing the attachment into the
packing gland by means of the steam tube and packing
gland key.</p>

<p class='c005'>The attachment should be removed from the gun and
cleaned immediately after firing, all metallic fouling being
carefully scraped away.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE FUSEE SPRING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>On the left of the breech casing, the rear end being
connected by the fusee chain and fusee with the crank,
the front end is attached to breech casing by means of
fusee spring box and adjusting screw which passes through
front end of fusee spring box and through the nut at front
end of spring.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Weigh and Adjust.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Cock the lock, place loop of spring balance over knob
of crank handle and pull vertically upwards, resting wrist
on breech casing, the reading indicated when crank handle
commences to move will be the weight of the fusee spring.
This should be between 5 and 7 lbs. (for converted Mark I
Guns between 10 and 12 lbs.).</p>

<p class='c005'>If spring is over, or not up to weight, remove fusee
spring box and adjust by means of adjusting screw, six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>turns making a difference of about 1 lb. (Turning screw
clockwise increases weight and vice versa.)</p>

<p class='c005'>The tension should always be kept as high as possible,
consistent with maintaining the normal rate of fire (500
rounds per minute).</p>

<h3 class='c016'>STRIPPING THE GUN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The gun is stripped in the following order:—</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—All pins are driven in from right to left, and out
in the reverse direction.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(i) <b>Lock and Feed Block.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Raise the cover, turn the crank handle on to the buffer
spring, see that the extractor drops, place finger between
the extractor and stop, raise the lock and allow the crank
handle to come slowly back on to the check lever; slide
the live cartridges out of the extractor, keeping the latter
down. Give the lock ⅛ turn to the left and lift off. Lift
the feed block out.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(ii) <b>Fusee Spring Box.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>With the right hand at the rear and the left hand at
the front, press the box forward until clear of the lugs, and
remove. Disconnect the fusee chain and remove the box
and the spring. Care should be taken to throw no cross
strain on the chain.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(iii) <b>Tangent Sight and Cover Lock.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Lower the cover, putting a screwdriver across the
breech casing under the gunmetal block, drive out the
axis pin of the stem and remove with its piston and spring.
Close the cover, press in the cover lock, and, with the
large screwdriver, remove the stop screw; the lock with
its piston and spring can then be removed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(iv) <b>Cover.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Drive out the fixing pin of the cover joint pin, remove
the collar and joint pin and take off the cover.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(v) <b>Rear Crosspiece.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Drive out the tapered fixing pin, grasp with the left
hand the left handle of the rear crosspiece, slightly raise
the casing and, with the mallet, strike the top edges of
the casing alternately until the rear crosspiece is clear of
the dovetails on the casing. Lift out the trigger bar.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>(vi) <b>Slides, Right and Left, and Check Lever.</b></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Pull out the slides. Drive out the fixing pin from the
check lever collar, remove the collar and check lever.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(vii) <b>Recoiling Portion.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Fold back the connecting rod on to the crank, turn the
crank handle to a vertical position, and draw out to the
rear the recoiling portion. Disconnect the side plates
by dropping them and springing them outwards. If
necessary, by taking out the fixing pin, the crank handle
can be driven off with a drift and hammer, and the fusee
unscrewed from the left bearing of the crank; but as a
rule these parts should not be stripped.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(viii) <b>Foresight.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>The position of the foresight should first be carefully
marked. Remove the fixing screw and foresight.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(ix) <b>Steam Tube and Packing Gland.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Up-end the barrel casing so that it stands on the rear
end of the breech casing. Remove the keeper screw and
unscrew the steam tube. Unscrew and remove the
packing gland and packing.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(x) <b>Breech and Barrel Casings, and Ejector Tube Spring.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Rest the barrel casing on a table or bench, with the
filling hole uppermost, and the breech casing clear of the
bench; place the left hand under the breech casing and
strike the top edges alternately with a mallet, when the
casings will come apart. Lift the ejector tube spring
with the point of the screwdriver and tap out the spring
with the drift and hammer. (In converted guns remove
fixing wire and unscrew fixing screws.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The breech and barrel casings should only be
separated when repairs are necessary. Care must be
taken not to strike the barrel casing, and the blows
should be struck as close to the dovetailing as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>(xi) <b>Lock.</b></p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>a</i>) Release the lock spring, lay the lock on a bench,
left side uppermost. Drive out the sear, tumbler, and
lock spring axis pins. (<i>b</i>) Remove the keeper bracket,
extractor levers, lock spring, tumbler, firing pin, and sear.
(<i>c</i>) Drive out the trigger axis pin, extractor stop keeper
pin, remove the trigger, extractor stop, and slide the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>extractor from the face of the lock casing. (<i>d</i>) Push out
the gib spring cover, take out the gib spring and gib.
(<i>e</i>) Drive out the extractor spring fixing pin, and remove
the extractor spring. (In converted guns the extractor
spring is riveted to the extractor.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—(<i>e</i>) should only be done in case of breakage.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(xii) <b>Feed Block.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) Drive out the spring fixing pin of the top and
bottom levers, drive out the bottom lever and remove the
top lever and slide. (<i>b</i>) Drive out the axis pin of the
bottom pawls and remove pawls with feed block spring.
(In converted guns unscrew fixing screws and remove
feed block springs.) (<i>c</i>) Drive out the fixing pin of the
band roller axis pin, remove the collar, axis pin, and band
roller. (<i>d</i>) Remove the top pawls from the slide by
pressing them outwards. The springs for the pawls, if
weak or broken, are only to be removed by an armourer
or qualified artificer.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(xiii) <b>Tangent Sight.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) Remove the top fixing screw of the graduated plate.
(<i>b</i>) Run the slide off the stem. (<i>c</i>) Remove the fixing
screw of the milled head, and lift the latter off the slide.
(<i>d</i>) Remove the fixing pin, pawl and pinion from the slide.
(<i>e</i>) Place the milled head, face upwards, on a bench;
then with a drift, applied to the rectangular nib on the
spring slide, knock the latter down flush with the face,
when it can be lifted out with the pliers.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(xiv) <b>Rear Crosspiece.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) Drive out the axis pin of the firing lever, and remove
the latter with its spiral spring. (<i>b</i>) Drive out the axis
pin of the safety catch, and lift out the latter, also the
piston and spring from their seating. (<i>c</i>) Remove the
pivot screw and shutter. (<i>d</i>) Unscrew, from the handles,
the milled heads with their leather washers and oil
brushes.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>EXAMINATION AND TESTING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Before assembling the gun all parts should be tried
in their places separately to see that they work freely, and
test friction of recoiling portions as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Cock lock, remove fusee spring box and spring, turn
crank handle upwards, hold it with right hand and fusee
with left, move recoiling portion, with gun horizontal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>backwards and forwards, to see that it works freely and
that barrel goes home. Weight necessary to move recoiling
portion should not exceed 4 lbs. (converted guns 7 lbs.)
tested by placing loop of spring balance over knob of
crank handle, and pulling to rear when handle is slightly
above the horizontal.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>ASSEMBLING THE GUN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Reverse all the foregoing operations with the exception
that the recoiling portions must be replaced before the
packing and packing gland. In order to assemble the
barrel and breech casings, they will have to be turned
upside-down—<i>i.e.</i>, the filling hole down, and the bottom
plate of breech casing uppermost—they should be positioned
by the crosshead joint pin. Care must be taken
that the ejector tube spring is in position before joining
the casings together. When assembling the feed block
the longer of the two bottom pawls must always be placed
at the front. When assembling the tangent sight, it
will be found convenient to place the slide on the stem
before attaching the milled head; in this position the
pinion is prevented from turning with the pawl when
engaging the arms of the slide spring outside the lugs in
the pawl.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE PARTS OF THE LOCK.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Should any of the components belonging to the lock
become defective they can be replaced from the spare
parts, without stripping the lock right down. Proceed
as follows:—</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(i) <b>Sear.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Fully cock, lift the sear, and let the firing pin engage
with the tumbler and trigger; with the lock on the bench,
left side up, drive out the sear axis pin, and remove the
sear with its spring.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(ii) <b>Tumbler.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Fully cock, thus engaging the firing pin with the sear;
drive out the axis pin of tumbler, pull the trigger slightly,
and lift out the tumbler.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Care should be taken not to allow the screwed
head to lift the sear when once the tumbler has been
removed.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>(iii) <b>Trigger, Lock Spring or Extractor Levers.</b></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Release the lock spring, drive out the lock spring axis
pin, remove the keeper bracket, extractor levers and lock
spring; if the trigger is defective, drive out the trigger
axis pin and remove the trigger.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(iv) <b>Firing Pin.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>Proceed as for (iii), but do not remove the trigger.
Remove the tumbler axis pin and tumbler, raise the sear,
push the screwed head out of its way, and the firing pin
will drop out.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(v) <b>Gib, Gib Spring, or Extractor Spring.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>This will necessitate the removal of the extractor from
the face of the lock casing. Release the lock spring,
drive out the lock spring axis pin, remove the keeper
bracket and extractor levers; next drive out the keeper
pin of the extractor stop, remove the latter, and slide
the extractor off the lock casing: push out the gib spring
cover, and remove the spring or gib as the case may be.
If the extractor spring requires replacing, drive out its
fixing pin and remove.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—The serviceable components are replaced in the
reverse order.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>STOPPAGES.</h3>

<h4 class='c015'>1. Temporary.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Due to (<i>a</i>) Failure of some part of the gun of which a
duplicate is carried, or faulty ammunition; (<i>b</i>) neglect
on the part of member or members of the detachment. A
high standard of training will avoid this.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>2. Prolonged.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Due to failure of some part of the gun which cannot,
as a rule, be put right under fire, or without skilled
assistance.</p>

<p class='c005'>In addition to the instructions in the “stoppage”
table, the following points should be observed:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. If, when the cover is opened to investigate cause of
stoppage, it is seen that extractor is not quite up, no
attempt should be made to raise it. It should be first
pushed down before the crank handle is turned over to
the front, as by this means all risk of firing a cartridge
accidentally is avoided.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>2. When a temporary stoppage necessitates the employment
of the spare lock, feed block, etc., the part which
has been removed should be repaired as soon as possible,
making it again available as a reserve.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Should it ever be necessary to release the lock spring,
with the lock out of gear, this should be done with the
extractor fully up, and firing pin hole opposite firing pin.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. As the clearing of a stoppage often knocks the sights
off the aiming mark, care should be taken that the gun
is immediately relaid.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—If the continued lightening of the fusee spring results in the
crank handle stopping in the third position, take muzzle attachment into
use, and put fusee spring back to normal weight (see para. 44).</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Worn or damaged side or extractor levers may result in the
extractor being unable to rise, or if the side levers are bent, there may
either be a succession of separated cases, or the lock may become jammed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The causes of prolonged stoppages are so varied that
they cannot be set out in detail. The following are
amongst the most probable, and the detachment should
be thoroughly trained to recognize them and to apply
such remedy as lies in their power pending a permanent
repair:—</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(i) <b>Broken Cover Springs.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>The extractor may not drop when the lock is drawn
back, and the gun will stop with the crank handle in the
first position. This may possibly be overcome by liberal
oiling of the lock, but in any case single shots can be fired
by holding the crank handle forward until the extractor
drops by its own weight.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(ii) <b>Broken Ejector Tube Spring</b>,</h4>

<p class='c014'>Causing either a block in the ejector tube or an accumulation
of empty cases in the breech casing. It may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>found possible to keep the gun in action if care is taken to
prevent the latter.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(iii) <b>Cotter working out</b>,</h4>

<h4 class='c015'>(iv) <b>Damaged Parts of the Lock, no Spare Part being available.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>The gun will fire without the sear, or if the bents of
the sear or firing pin are badly worn or broken off, but
only single shots, and only by pressing and releasing the
double button quickly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun will also fire if the nose of the trigger or bent
of the tumbler is badly worn or broken off, but only rapid
firing. In this case the gun will fire the instant the crank
handle reaches the check level, although the double button
has not been pressed.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun can be worked as follows:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Group the cartridges in the belt, say 20 or 30 rounds each group.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Lay the gun before commencing to load, place crank handle on buffer spring, pull belt to 
    left and let handle go; repeat, but before allowing the handle to reach check lever and 
    the gun to fire, grip the rear crosspiece with left hand to control gun in the ordinary 
    way.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>If necessary firing can be stopped by throwing the filled
end of the belt over the breech casing to the left.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the firing has been stopped as described above,
hold the crank handle with the right hand, open the cover,
press down the horns of the extractor, draw the lock back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and, if there is a live cartridge on the face of the extractor,
remove the feed block and belt, close the cover, and allow
the lock to fly forward, when the live cartridge, which is
on the face of the extractor, will be fired automatically.
The lock can then be changed with safety. On no account
should the lock be allowed to fly forward until the feed
block has been removed and the cover shut.</p>

<p class='c005'>If, on drawing the lock back, it is found that there is
no live cartridge on its face, the lock may be changed at
once, and the necessity for removing the feed block and
the subsequent precautions will not arise.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>(v) <b>Gunmetal Valve Working Loose.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>This will prevent the barrel from going home. It may
be temporarily remedied by tapping it round with a
hammer and punch, but it should be tightened at the
earliest opportunity with the gib key, the barrel being
removed from the gun.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principal features are as in Maxim with the
following exceptions:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Total weight, ready for firing, is 38½ lbs. (Maxim, 67 lbs.).</p>

<p class='c005'>Length, width and depth slightly less than Maxim.</p>

<p class='c005'>Barrel casing is of corrugated steel (affording greater
cooling surface).</p>

<p class='c005'>Rear end of barrel—<i>i.e.</i>, chamber—goes back into barrel
casing, thus greatly assisting cooling of barrel where it
is most essential.</p>

<p class='c005'>Foresight is blade pattern, with protector.</p>

<p class='c005'>No ejector tube or spring, there being an opening at
bottom of breech casing through which empty cases fall.
(Shutter requires to be opened before commencing firing.)</p>

<p class='c005'>Tangent sight is 2½ in. nearer rear end of breech casing
and is U pattern.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is no buffer spring or resistance piece.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>An elevating stop on outside of left-hand plate, this
preventing the bracket head of the mounting damaging
the fusee spring box.</p>

<p class='c005'>No stud for the shoulder piece.</p>

<p class='c005'>Connecting rod has an adjusting nut and washers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Crank handle revolves in the opposite direction to
Maxim.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lock is inverted and joined to connecting rod by an
interrupted flange.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lock has no extractor spring, as cases fall off extractor
when clear of barrel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lock can be easily stripped with the hand screw which
forms the axis pin of the trigger bar lever.</p>

<p class='c005'>Top pawls are made with finger pieces, and can be
pressed down by hand to allow belt to be released, having
only one spring, which is removable.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fusee spring can be adjusted without removing box,
as the vice pin of screw is loose.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fusee has a clutch fixture, and is easily removable.</p>

<p class='c005'>No tools required to strip lock or change barrel.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gun cannot be fired unless cover is down.</p>

<p class='c005'>Greater general strength, especially in recoiling portions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sighted to 2,900 yards.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>TO MOUNT AND DISMOUNT GUN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>As for Maxim (page <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>).</p>

<h3 class='c016'>TO LOAD AND UNLOAD GUN.</h3>

<h4 class='c015'>To Load Gun.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Pass tag end of belt through feed block from right side.
Pull crank handle on to roller with right hand. Pull
belt straight through as far as it will go with left hand.
Let go crank handle; the first cartridge will then be
gripped by extractor. Repeat as above; the first cartridge
will then be in chamber and another gripped by
upper part of extractor. Gun is then ready for firing.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Unload Gun.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Pull crank handle on to roller twice in succession
(without pulling belt), letting it fly forward to check
lever each time. Press up bottom pawls and remove
belt from feed block, then release lock spring.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>TO CLEAN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>As for Maxim (page <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>MUZZLE ATTACHMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A steel muzzle attachment for ball firing is provided
to assist recoil. When attachment is fitted on gun, the
gland replaces the packing gland. The muzzle cup is
fixed to barrel by a clamping screw, body of which lies
in a circular groove on barrel, thus preventing muzzle
cup from being blown off should clamping screw become
loose. Outer casing is attached to gland by an interrupted
flange and spring-keeper pin. Front cone screws
into front end of outer casing, and, to protect its face
from erosion, is covered by a thin steel disc, which, when
badly eroded, can be replaced by a spare one. Gland and
front cone have flanges which are grooved to receive the
combination tool provided for assembling and stripping
purposes.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>FUSEE SPRING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>On the left of breech casing there is a strong spiral
spring called the fusee spring, the rear end of which is
connected by the fusee chain and fusee with the crank;
the fore-end is attached to the breech casing by means of
the fusee spring box and adjusting screw, which passes
through the front end of fusee spring box, and through
the nut at the front end of spring.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fusee spring can be adjusted without removing the
box, as the vice pin of the screw is loose. This screw is
kept in position by two nibs which fall into recesses, by
the tension of the fusee spring. The fusee is attached to
the crank by means of a stem and lugs, and is easily
removed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Weigh and Adjust Fusee Spring.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Take out lock; place loop of spring balance over knob
of crank handle, and, standing on left side of gun, press
down check lever with left hand. Pull spring balance
vertically up, resting right wrist on breech casing. The
reading indicated when crank handle commences to move
will be the weight of fusee spring. This weight should
be between 7 and 9 lbs. If spring is over, or not up to
weight, adjust by means of vice pin. Generally six clicks
(three revolutions) make a difference of about 1 lb.
Adjust by ½–lbs. as a rule.</p>

<p class='c005'>Turning vice pin clockwise increases weight and vice versa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tension of spring should always be kept as high as
possible, consistent with maintaining normal rate of
500 rounds per minute.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>TO STRIP AND ASSEMBLE GUN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The gun is stripped in the following order:—</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Lock.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Clear extractor by revolving crank handle twice; pull
crank handle on to roller; raise rear cover, place finger
between extractor and stop, lift lock, at same time
allowing crank handle to move slowly forward until lock
is released from side plates. Give lock one-sixth of a
turn in either direction and lift out.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Feed Block.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Release front cover catch, raise front cover, and lift
out.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Fusee Spring Box.</h4>

<p class='c014'>With right hand at rear and left hand at front, press
box forward until clear of lugs and remove. Disconnect
fusee chain and remove box and spring. Care should be
taken to throw no cross strain on chain.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Fusee.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Turn fusee to rear until lugs on stem are free to be
withdrawn.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Ball Firing Attachment.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Withdraw split pin. Give outer casing one-sixth turn
and remove it. Unscrew front cone. Loosen clamping
screw of muzzle cup and revolve cup till clamping screw
coincides with flat on barrel. Remove muzzle cup.
Unscrew and remove gland.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Slides, Right and Left.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Raise rear cover, unscrew rear crosspiece screwed
fixing T-pin, and hinge down rear crosspiece. Pull out
sides.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Recoiling Portion.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Draw recoiling portion out to rear. Disconnect side
plates from barrel, removing left one first (for convenience
only). If necessary, by taking out fixing pin, crank
handle can be driven off with a drift and hammer, but as
a rule this should not be stripped.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Roller.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Remove split fixing pin, collar, and roller.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>To Strip Lock.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) See that lock is cocked; force out side lever split
pin and axis bush. Remove side levers and extractor
levers and slide extractor from front of lock casing.
(<i>b</i>) Release lock spring and push out the trigger and
tumbler axis pins. (<i>c</i>) Remove trigger, tumbler, lock
spring, firing pin and sear with spring. To strip extractor,
push out gib spring cover and remove spring and gib.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Tangent Sight and Spring.</h4>

<p class='c014'>(<i>a</i>) Remove top fixing screw of graduated plate.
(<i>b</i>) Run the slide off stem. (<i>c</i>) Remove fixing screw of
milled head and lift latter off slide. (<i>d</i>) Remove fixing
pin, pawl, and pinion from slide. (<i>e</i>) Place the milled
head, face upwards, on a bench; then, with small screwdriver
applied to rectangular nib on slide spring, knock
latter down flush with face, when it can be lifted out with
pliers.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>EXAMINATION AND TESTING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Before assembling the gun all parts should be tried in
their places separately to see that they work freely.</p>

<p class='c005'>Test friction of recoiling portions (as Maxim, page <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Assembling.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Reverse all foregoing operations with exception that
recoiling portions must be replaced before packing and
packing gland. When assembling lock, care must be
taken that lock spring is replaced with lock in fired
position, and when all the other parts are assembled.
When assembling rear crosspiece see that pawl of firing
lever engages with trigger bar lever. When assembling
tangent sight, it will be found convenient to place slide
on stem (axis end) before attaching the milled head; in
this position pinion is prevented from turning with pawl
when engaging arms of spring outside lugs on pawl.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BELT FILLING.</h3>

<p class='c014'>All numbers, also drivers, should be instructed and
practised in belt filling by hand, and also with the belt-filling
machine, as follows:—</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Belt Filling by Hand.</h4>

<p class='c014'>One Man Loading by Hand.—Sit on the ground, with
the right foot doubled under the left thigh, the left foot
resting on the outer side and drawn towards the right
knee.</p>

<p class='c005'>Place the belt on the left knee, with the tag pointing
to the right. Take hold of the first brass strip between
the forefinger and thumb; then with the remaining
fingers and ball of the thumb, hold the belt so that the
pockets will remain open. Take five cartridges in the
right hand, insert into pockets, taking care to avoid
doubling over the thin edge of webbing. Now place the
belt on the knee, and, placing the tips of the fingers on
the front of the belt, finally adjust the cartridges by
pushing them forward with the thumb until the points
of the bullets are in line with the <i>ends</i> of the long brass
strips. Continue to load and adjust in fives, and make
a final inspection when placing the belt in the box.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Belt Filling by Machine.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Fix machine so that crank handle can be worked with
right hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Unfold loading tray and leg, the tray being secured
to the left of bed plate by pin, the leg being made rigid
by turning up the keeper plate on to the pin catch.</p>

<p class='c005'>Turn the steel guide plate (on bed plate) outwards.
Pocket opener must be far enough back to clear the
belt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Place belt behind roller and into belt guide. Edge of
belt to be touching side of guide, projecting end of long
brass strips to point away from cartridge plunger, and to
pass under the steel guide.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pawl to lie on top of belt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Turn steel guide into position again and draw belt
through with left hand until first pocket is opposite pocket
opener.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fill hopper with cartridges and replenish as required.</p>

<p class='c005'>Revolve crank handle continuously (not too fast) until
belt is filled.</p>

<p class='c005'>(A light pressure should be kept on the belt with the
left hand until the weight of the filled portion is sufficient
to assist the pawl.)</p>

</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>Description.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The gun complete weighs 25¼ lbs. and can be withdrawn
from its leather case and put into action immediately.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are only 62 parts in the gun proper—these cannot
be wrongly assembled, and require no adjustment.</p>

<p class='c005'>No water is used for cooling purposes, the steel barrel
being closely fitted with a jacket of aluminium having
deeply-cut grooves throughout its length. Over this is a
thin tubular steel casing, the muzzle end of which extends
(in reduced diameter) beyond the end of barrel, the special
shaped mouthpiece screwed to the end of barrel serving
the double purpose of firmly securing the radiator in place
and of directing the powder blast of each discharge as to
greatly increase the “ejector action” of this blast in
sucking cool air through the grooves of the radiator.
The system is so effective that the gun is found to give a
slightly greater velocity to the bullet than can be obtained
from the same length of barrel in a shoulder arm firing the
same ammunition. There is no excessive recoil and the
gun can be used with or without mount.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun is fed from a rotating drum magazine, which is
controlled by the reciprocating breech mechanism.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Shell Deflector.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The shell deflector is an attachment for controlling the
ejection of empty cartridge cases. It is very readily and
quickly attached, and when in position can be instantly
swung back out of the way so that the inside of the
gun may be examined or any part of the mechanism
got at.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Light Folding Field Mount.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Is a three-and-a-half-pound folding mount adapted for
general use with infantry and cavalry. The mount is
surprisingly rigid, and permits of very accurate shooting.
Both front and rear mounting yokes, connected through
centre post and rear brace, are pivoted about the axis of
the centre post, so that the gun is always free to traverse.
The gun is also free to turn within the yokes, so that the
sights may always be kept vertical, no matter what the
position of the feet. When the mount is attached, it is
often convenient to use the rear brace as a handle for carrying
the gun.</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>To Put Gun into Action.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When a loaded magazine is dropped into place over the
magazine post, and the charging handle pulled to the rear
as far as it will go and then released, the gun is put into
action by a pull on the trigger, and continues to fire until
the finger pressure on the trigger is released, or until the
magazine is empty.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Single Shots.</h4>

<p class='c014'>When the trigger is pulled once and very quickly
released a single shot is fired, this may be repeated at will
until the magazine is empty.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Semi-Automatic Fire.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Within the limits of the magazine capacity the gun
continues to fire so long as the trigger is held back, and
stops firing whenever the trigger is released.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Full Automatic Fire.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Continued pressure on the trigger results in full
automatic fire, which need be interrupted only by the four
seconds interval required to replace emptied magazines
by loaded ones.</p>

<p class='c005'>During firing, before the magazine has been emptied,
the gun stops at the beginning of the forward stroke, in
the “ready to feed” position.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this position the action is open and the chamber
empty, but firing can be resumed on pulling the trigger.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>General Note.</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Before Firing.</b>—See to it that bore is clear, working
parts properly lubricated, and that tension of main spring
is sufficient to avoid missfires.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>After Firing.</b>—See that gun is immediately unloaded,
and that bore, working parts, and bearing surfaces are
carefully examined, cleaned, and properly lubricated as
soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is especially important to oil piston head and inside
of gas cylinder; and to remove oil, and replace gas
regulator cup.</p>

<p class='c005'>Burrs found raised on any working part should be
removed, and any roughening on a bearing surface should
be smoothed down with fine emery or an oilstone.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>TO STRIP AND ASSEMBLE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The gun may be taken apart starting with the
mechanism in any position, but it is best, whenever practicable,
to see that the magazine is removed, the chamber
empty, and the charging handle at the extreme forward end
of its stroke, before commencing to dissemble. If this
procedure is followed there will be no need to readjust the
mainspring tension or to make any other adjustment
when the gun is reassembled.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Stripping.</h4>

<p class='c014'>To dissemble gun, insert point of a bullet into slot
leading to butt latch and push forward against force of
butt latch spring. At the same time twist buttstock up
and to left, then remove by withdrawing it to the rear.
This removes buttstock group which should not be further
dissembled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next, hold back trigger and pull back guard until clear
of receiver. This removes guard, which contains trigger
mechanism and butt latch.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pull down gear casing until it drops clear of rack.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pull back charging handle until it reaches end of slot,
then withdraw by pulling it out away from receiver.</p>

<p class='c005'>Withdraw operating rod complete and bolt complete
by pulling them both together to rear until clear of
receiver.</p>

<p class='c005'>With point of a bullet push back on receiver lock pin,
then twist receiver up and to left and unscrew it from
barrel.</p>

<p class='c005'>The foregoing operations divide the gun into convenient
groups.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>DETAILED STRIPPING.</h3>

<h4 class='c015'>Buttstock Group.</h4>

<p class='c014'>It is best never to strip this group, but if found necessary,
the screws securing buttplate and butt tang to buttstock
are readily removed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Receiver Group.</h4>

<p class='c014'>See that the feed operating arm is pushed to the right,
then pull back and remove feed cover.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Feed Cover.</b>—From the feed cover the stop pawl,
rebound pawl and cartridge guide spring are readily
removed with the point of a bullet.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span><b>Back Sight.</b>—The back sight may be stripped from
feed cover by removing bed spring screw.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Feed Operating Arm.</b>—Remove feed operating arm
complete, by pushing forward on feed operating arm latch
and then lifting clear of magazine post. The feed pawl
and feed pawl spring are removed from feed operating
arm by lifting them clear of the studs. The latch should
not be removed.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Ejector.</b>—With the point of a bullet lift and pull out
ejector cover and the ejector.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Safety.</b>—The safeties may be prised out of the receiver
with a bullet point.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gear case hinge pin and centre key are permanently
assembled and should not be removed.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Gear Casing.</b>—Push forward and remove receiver
lock pin and unhook gear casing from gear case hinge
pin.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Mainspring Group.</h4>

<p class='c014'>To strip completely the parts assembled in gear casing,
raise the gear stop with the point of a bullet, and allow
mainspring to unwind.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Gear.</b>—Then unscrew the collet pin and shake out
gear.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Mainspring.</b>—Pushing with a bullet through the gear
against mainspring collet forces out mainspring casing
from which mainspring, with its locating rivets and mainspring
collet, may also be removed by the use of a bullet.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Gear Stop.</b>—The gear stop and gear stop spring should
not be stripped, but in case of necessity they may be
removed by driving out the gear stop pin.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Guard Group.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The assembled guard contains trigger mechanism and
butt latch. To strip, punch out trigger pin and sear pin.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Trigger.</b>—Pull back trigger and lift out.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Sear.</b>—Remove sear, sear spring box and sear spring.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Butt Latch.</b>—Punch out butt latch pin and remove
butt latch, and butt latch spring.</p>

<p class='c005'>In ordinary practice the guard group need never be
stripped.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>Bolt and Rod Group.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The bolt and rod group comprises the bolt complete and
operating rod complete. These two assembled parts are
withdrawn together from the receiver, and may then be
separated by lifting bolt clear of operating post on rod.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Bolt Complete.</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Feed Operating Stud.</b>—Unscrew and remove feed
operating stud from rear end of bolt.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Extractors.</b>—The extractors are spring-tempered and
are sprung into place. To remove, insert point of a bullet
under extractor claw and push head of extractor out and
away from bolt. At the same time draw the whole
extractor forward until it is clear of its seating.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Operating Rod Complete.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Not usually stripped.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Piston.</b>—The piston connecting pin is riveted in place,
but may readily be punched out in case it is desired to
remove piston.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Striker.</b>—The striker may be withdrawn after punching
out striker fixing pin.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Barrel Group.</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Gas Regulator.</b>—Lift out gas regulator key, then
unscrew and remove gas regulator cup.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Clamp Ring.</b>—Using the gas regulator key as a tool,
unscrew clamp ring screw and remove clamp ring which
carries front sight and clamp ring positioning screw.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Radiator Casing.</b>—Pull forward radiator casing front,
and pull back radiator casing rear which is permanently
assembled to radiator casing rear locking piece.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Gas Cylinder.</b>—Unscrew and remove gas cylinder,
using operating rod as a wrench.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Gas Chamber.</b>—Unscrew gas chamber, using, if
necessary, barrel mouthpiece wrench.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Barrel Mouthpiece.</b>—Unscrew barrel mouthpiece.
Thread is left-handed.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Barrel.</b>—Drive out barrel from radiator. This operation
may conveniently be accomplished before removing
barrel mouthpiece by unscrewing latter part way and then
allowing barrel and radiator to drop from a height of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>or three feet on to a solid piece of wood, striking on front
end of barrel mouthpiece. The weight of the radiator
dropping from this height will usually loosen barrel sufficiently
so that it can be withdrawn by hand from radiator
after mouthpiece has been removed.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Gas Chamber Band.</b>—Lift out gas chamber band from
its recess in radiator.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Assembling.</h4>

<p class='c014'>By reversing the operations for stripping the assembling
of gun is readily and quickly carried out. The following
points, however, should be noted:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Be sure that gas chamber band is correctly inserted
into its place in the radiator before barrel is pushed home,
and that barrel is turned with gas port at bottom.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. In replacing bolt and operating rod the cam slot in
bolt is slipped over striker and feed operating stud is
screwed into bolt as far as it will go.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. After inserting bolt, rod, and charging handle, the
charging handle is carried forward to extreme end of its
stroke before gear casing is swung up into place and rack
engaged.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. The mainspring is wound up by engaging the rack and
gear, disengaging the guard, and pulling back on the
charging handle until the required tension is obtained.
The gear is then disengaged, charging handle moved completely
forward, gear re-engaged and guard pushed home.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. To reduce tension of mainspring proceed as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Remove buttstock.</div>
      <div class='line'>Disengage both guard and gear.</div>
      <div class='line'>Move charging handle part way back.</div>
      <div class='line'>Re-engage gear and guard.</div>
      <div class='line'>Replace buttstock.</div>

<p class='c005'>The gun will swing horizontally through a complete
circle of 360 degrees. The muzzle may be depressed
39 degrees and elevated 31 degrees, giving a vertical
range of 70 degrees.</p>

<p class='c005'>The barrel, which is detachable, is connected with the
breech casing in which the mechanism for charging,
firing and ejecting is contained.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cartridges are automatically fed into the gun by means
of a belt containing 250, running from a box attached to
the left side of the breech casing.</p>

<p class='c005'>The automatic action of the gun is effected by means
of the pressure of the powder gases in the barrel. There
is a small radial vent in the barrel near the muzzle, opening
downward from the bore. This vent is closed by a piston
which fits in the gas cylinder surrounding the outer edge
of the vent. The piston is pivoted to the gas lever so
that it adjusts itself to the gas cylinder while the lever
swings in a vertical plane.</p>

<p class='c005'>The belt is inserted from the left; the lever thrown
downward and rearward as far as it will go. This opens
the breech and feeds the first cartridge from the belt to
the carrier; the lever is then released, and the spring
causes it to swing forward, close the vent and transfer the
cartridge from the carrier to the barrel; also cocking the
hammer, closing and locking the breech.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>On pulling the trigger the cartridge is fired. After the
bullet has passed the vent and before its exit from the
muzzle, the powder gases expand through the vent upon
the piston and gas lever, which in turn act on the breech
mechanism, opening the breech, ejecting the shell and
feeding to the carrier another cartridge. The gas lever,
returning, under the action of the retractor spring, forces
the cartridge into the chamber, closing and locking the
breech. If, instead of releasing the trigger, it is held
back, the same operation will be repeated as long as cartridges
are supplied, producing continuous fire at the
rate of 400 shots or more per minute.</p>

<p class='c005'>A safety lock secures the hammer, the latter being also
used as a piston for an air-pump, forcing a strong jet of
air into the chamber and through the barrel, removing all
residue after the empty shell is ejected.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>The mainspring, firing-pin and extractor</b> can be
easily replaced.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>The mount</b> consists of two principal parts:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Saddle with toothed arc.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Yoke.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'><b>The saddle</b>, in which the gun rests, is pivoted to the
yoke by means of the axis bolt, so as to swing in a vertical
plane. The gun is held in position on the saddle by the gun
pin, which is inserted with its handle vertical; in any
other position of the handle the gun is held secure by the
gun pin lock screw.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Changes of elevation</b> are made by means of the
worm gear, which engages in the teeth of the arc, and is
operated by the hand wheel, being secured at any angle
by the arc clamp.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lower part of the yoke is in the form of a spindle,
and fits in the socket of the tripod, being secured by a
spindle washer and spindle washer bolt.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>The tripod</b> consists of a socket to which the legs are
hinged. The two front ones being interchangeable, brass
shoes are attached to prevent their sinking into the ground
during firing.</p>

<p class='c005'>A seat is attached to the lower portion of the rear leg,
also a leather tool bag containing spare parts, etc.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Instructions for Operation.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Attach box in firing position on the left side of mount.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>To Load.</b>—Push belt through opening above the box
from the left and draw it as far as it will go. Let go
the belt. (Never pull on the belt while the gas lever is
being operated.) Swing the gas lever downward to the
rear until it strikes the bottom plate of the gun. Release
gas lever, when it will resume its normal position.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun is now ready to fire.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>To Fire.</b>—Hold back trigger. The firing will continue
until the trigger is released or until all the cartridges in
the belt are fired.</p>

<p class='c005'>To hold the gun ready for firing, push the safety latch
on right side of gun below rear sight from “fire” to
“safe.”</p>

<p class='c005'><b>To Draw Belt and Cartridges from the Gun.</b>— Push
forward the knurled head on the right side of the
gun near the belt exit and draw the loaded belt out to the
left. Then operate the lever once by hand, as in loading,
ejecting the loaded cartridge that remains in the chamber.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Missfires.</b>—Wait a moment in order to make sure that
it is a missfire and not a hangfire. Then operate the gas
lever by hand, as in loading, which will eject the unexploded
cartridge and will re-load ready for continued
firing.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><b>Stoppage from any Cause.</b>—Whether the stoppage
occurs from the jamming of a cartridge, missfire, or breakage
of a part of the gun, operate the lever once by hand
before making any effort to free the mechanism.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the stoppage occurs when the lever is partially
retracted, push it backward until it strikes the bottom
plate. Never push it forward. This will generally free
the mechanism, unless a broken part stops it. If not
freed, draw belt and cartridges from the gun and examine
for breakages.</p>

<p class='c005'>In case of jamming, due to failure to eject empty shell,
draw back the lever until it strikes the bottom plate,
letting the live cartridge and carrier descend into the
bottom position, and remove shell with cleaning rod. The
lever is now free to resume its normal position. In this
case, examine the extractor, and, if broken or chipped,
or the spring does not work well, replace it.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Precautions to be observed.</b>—After dismounting
mechanism and before firing is begun, a belt of cartridges
(preferably dummies) should be placed in the gun and the
lever operated several times by hand, as in loading, to
see if mechanism is in proper working order.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Caution.</b>—With the gun hot from rapid firing, a cartridge
should not be allowed to remain in the chamber
longer than six or seven seconds, as it may be discharged
by the heat. In case it is not possible, from any cause,
to withdraw the cartridge within this time, and the lever
is in its normal position, no harm will be done; but if
lever is partially retracted, the bolt is then withdrawn
and a “blow back” may occur. In either event, keep
away from in front of the muzzle until satisfied that the
danger from the explosion of the cartridge by heat is
passed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Dismount Breech Mechanism.</h4>

<p class='c014'>1. Take hold of the gas lever pin and throw the gas
lever rearward until it strikes the bottom plate. Then
release the gas lever, when it will fly forward to its original
position. This movement cocks the hammer.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c005'>2. On the right-hand side of the gun, in front of the
trigger, is the handle lock, which is a pin with a small
projecting lever resting in a horizontal position. Turn
this lever upward and backward as far as possible. Withdraw
the handle lock. This releases the handle, which
then can be removed rearward. The handle contains
the mainspring, hammer, sear, sear spring, trigger and
trigger spring. To remove the hammer and mainspring
from the handle, pull back the trigger, release the sear by
pulling the nose down, when the hammer and mainspring
will fly out, as the sear holds them in place.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. To remove the bolt, throw the gas lever rearward as
far as possible, and while holding it in that position insert
the small end of the handle lock in the hole on the right
hand side of gun, pushing the handle lock in as far as it
will go. This removes the bolt pin from the bolt. Withdraw
the handle lock pin, but leave the bolt pin in the
position in which it now is—<i>i.e.</i>, projecting from the left
side. The bolt is now free to be removed from the rear
of the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. The extractor and firing pin can be removed from
the bolt by pushing out the small pins that hold them in
place.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>To Assemble.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>1. Insert the bolt and push forward as far as it will go.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Place hand on gas lever, holding it up against bottom
plate.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Push in bolt pin from left hand side as far as it will
go.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Then release the gas lever.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. Replace handle, locking it in position with handle
lock.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Remove Barrel.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Take hold of gas lever pin and throw the gas lever rearward
until it strikes the bottom plate, and hold in this
position. Withdraw handle lock and insert small end of
same in small hole in rear end of gun, and on right side,
pushing handle lock in as far as it will go. This causes
the bolt pin to lock slide to receiver and to hold gas lever
back. Bolt pin will then project from left-hand side.
Leave in this position. Replace handle lock.</p>

<p class='c005'>Attached to gas cylinder will be found barrel lock;
place small end of combination wrench under point of
barrel lock and press down and out until it clears barrel.
Engage combination wrench in slot in under side of barrel
just forward of gas cylinder and unscrew; then pull
barrel forward and out.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>To Replace Barrel.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Push barrel in as far as it will go and engage threads;
complete this operation with wrench until lines on top of
barrel and receiver coincide. Swing barrel lock up into
slot. Release gas lever by pushing in bolt pin from left-hand
side as far as it will go with handle lock. Replace
handle lock. Do not remove or replace barrel until gas
lever has been thrown to rear and locked in that position.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Strip.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Lay gun on right side, muzzle to left. Turn side plate
lock screw to left to bring cut in same clear of groove in
side plate screws. Unscrew side plate screws and remove.
Place right hand on rear of left-hand side plate, press
downward, and with the left hand raise front of plate.
Turn gun over and remove right-hand plate in same
manner. Turn gun so as to bring bottom plate upward.
Raise gas lever slightly with left hand, and lift bottom
plate out. Raise gas lever again and pull out slide pin.
Push slide to rear until it remains. Remove retracting
spring tubes by pulling nearest tube toward you and
pushing other away from you. Pull or push out gas lever
bracket pin, then lift gas lever and connections out of
bracket. Push carrier pin out with pointed end of screwdriver
and lift carrier out of receiver. Unscrew locking
screw and belt guide screw in belt guide. Lift belt guide
out. If belt guide should stick, push the point of screwdriver
under the slide at rear of belt guide and gently pry
upward. Remove handle lock and pull handle out to rear.
Push slide to rear and insert end of handle lock in small
hole in rear of receiver in side nearest to you, and push
out bolt pin. Pull slide to front and out and then push
bolt out to rear with finger. Remove safety and trip.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>To Assemble.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Hold gun with slot in receiver upward. Insert bolt,
front end first. Replace slide, pushing to rear as far as
it will go. Replace bolt pin, pushing it in as far as it
will go by using end of handle lock. Replace belt guide
and screw, having locking screw engage groove in belt guide
screw. Replace carrier, having flat side or bottom
up and carrier dog down. Insert pin. Replace gas lever,
having piston drop into hole in gas cylinder. Adjust gas
lever until large pin holes in gas lever and gas lever bracket
are opposite each other, then insert gas-lever bracket pin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Next place retracting spring tubes in position having slot
in followers align with long slot in retracting spring tubes.
Force follower over projecting end of retracting connection
by pressing follower end inward, at the same time slightly
compressing retracting springs until pilot at end of tube
clears bracket. Press tube inward at bracket end and
into hole for pilot. Place bottom plate in position by
putting tongue at rear end in receiver first and flush with
rear end of receiver. Place safety in position. Right-hand
side plate should be next placed in position, taking
precaution to have slide pushed to rear as far as it will
go and the feed lever on plate carried to rear as far as it
will go, so that feed lever will lay between projections on
slide when plate is in position. To place plate in position,
have the dowel at rear of plate enter hole for same, in
receiver, at the same time having groove near edge of
plate engage rib on bottom plate and gas lever bracket
pin enter hole in front end of plate. Turn gun over
to rest on plate, draw slide forward, having slot
at forward end of slide engage end of gas-lever
connection. Hold gun at rear end with right hand to
prevent moving. Take hold of gas-lever pin with the
left hand and swing gas lever outward until slide pin
can be pushed into hole in slide through gas-lever connection,
having flattened end of slide pin enter slot in
side plate. Place trip in holes and slot in receiver. Place
left-hand slide plate in position by the same method
as right-hand plate. Place side plate screws into holes
in front and rear of side plates. If screws do not enter
freely see that bottom plate is flush with rear of receiver;
if not, tap bottom plate gently on front end until it is
flush with rear end of receiver. Screw plates together
and lock with locking screws, making a quarter turn of
these screws to engage grooves in side plate screws. Push
handle into hole in rear of receiver and lock with handle
lock. Handle lock is placed in position by inserting
large end into hole with the stem held upward and then
turned toward front and downward to have projection
engage locking cut in side plate and until handle lock
stop springs over stem. Place gun in mount and run a
few cartridges in a belt through gun to see that mechanism
works properly. Keep hand away from trigger during
this latter operation, and be sure to work gas lever until
all cartridges are out of gun.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The gun comprises a single barrel, receiver, guard and
stock, rigidly assembled. Guided in the receiver, parallel
to and below the barrel, is the piston, which by its reciprocating
motion assures the automatic action of the gun.
This reciprocating motion is brought about as follows:—When
the bullet in its passage through the bore has passed
a port connecting the bore with the gas nozzle, a small
portion of the powder gas issues from the nozzle, and
impinging in the cup-shaped forward extremity of the
piston, throws in the rear. The recoil spring compressed
by the piston in its rearward movement now returns the
piston to its initial position.</p>

<p class='c005'>In its movement to the rear the piston, which is
accompanied by the breech block, opens the breech,
extracts and ejects the spent cartridge case, and brings
a fresh cartridge to the loading position. In its forward
movement the breech is locked and the shot fired.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Feed.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The cartridges are fed into the gun on flat, tempered
steel strips, of 30 rounds each.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>A folding barrel rest</b> is provided for steadying the
barrel when firing in the prone position which will
ordinarily be taken.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>For aircraft</b> the gun is mounted on a crutch, and the
stock may be replaced by a pistol grip.</p>

<p class='c005'>The operation of the gun requires but one man, who
loads and fires. If a second operator loads the speed of
fire is increased from 250 to 400 rounds per minute.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>ACTION OF THE MECHANISM</h3>

<p class='c014'><b>To load</b>, the breech must be opened by means of the
cocking handle. As the piston is drawn back, cams
on its upper face turn the fermeture nut a partial revolution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>disengaging its interrupted threads from corresponding
threads on the nose of breech block. This
unlocks the breech. Under the action of its spring, the
feed piece engages with a shoulder on the piston and locks
it in its rearmost position.</p>

<p class='c005'>To permit the introduction of the feed strip, the feed
piece must be lifted to its highest position by pressing
up on its lower end. This frees it from the shoulder of
the piston, which latter moves forward slightly under
the action of its spring and engages with the sear. The
feed strip may now be introduced into the guides, cartridge
side down, and should be pushed forward until the pawl
forming part of the feed spring engages with it, so as to
prevent any backward movement.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the trigger is pulled, the piston, accompanied
by the breech block, is propelled forward by the recoil
spring; the breech block pushes a cartridge from the feed
strip into the chamber; the cams on the upper face of
the piston act on the fermeture nut, locking the breech;
the firing pin is driven against the primer and the shot
fired.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the bullet in its passage through the bore has
passed the port leading to the gas nozzle, a small portion
of the powder gas, conducted by the port and the gas
nozzle, impinges in the cup-shaped forward extremity
of the piston, and drives it to the rear. As already
explained, the breech is now unlocked by the action of the
piston cams on the fermeture nut, the breech block is
withdrawn, along with the extractor holding the spent
cartridge case, which later is ejected when its head strikes
the ejector.</p>

<p class='c005'>Towards the end of the backward stroke of the piston
a cam on its side imparts a slight rotary movement to the
feed piece, which advances the feed strip sufficiently to
bring the following cartridge to the loading position.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last cartridge having been fired, the strip is ejected
from the gun. Under the action of its spring, the feed
piece, which has been held up by the strip, now descends,
and, engaging with the shoulder of the piston, locks the
breech open. All is now ready for the introduction of
another strip.</p>

<p class='c005'>The firing gear may be set for continuous firing, single
shots, or safety, by turning the cocking handle to the
positions marked “A,” “R” and “S,” respectively.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>When set at “A” (automatic), so long as the trigger is
held back, the piston is free to move forward again under
the action of the recoil spring. As a result the gun fires
continuously until the strip is exhausted or the trigger
released.</p>

<p class='c005'>When set at “R” (repetition), a separate pull of the
trigger is required for each shot, as the sear engages
with the piston each time the latter recoils, thus stopping
the firing.</p>

<p class='c005'>When set at “S” (safety) the trigger is locked, and
cannot be pulled back. As a result the gun cannot be
fired.</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Cock gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Pass cleaning rod down the bore to make sure that
barrel is clear.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. See that regulators of all available barrels are properly
set.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Oil mechanism. A moderate quantity of oil will
suffice. It is useless to flood the mechanism. As the
essential parts are sufficiently accessible through the
ejection slot and by opening the feed piece cover, dismounting
is not necessary.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. Test action of both ejector and cartridge stop by
pushing on their points. They should work freely, their
springs being elastic but without stiffness.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. Test action of mechanism by rapidly opening and
closing breech several times. It should work freely and
smoothly.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>OPERATING THE GUN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In firing, the prone position will be taken ordinarily,
the barrel rest being used to steady the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>In high grass or under conditions where more height is
desirable, ammunition boxes may be placed under the

    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Safety: Set cocking handle at “S” (safety) and remove strip, unless firing is to be 
    promptly resumed.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>N.B.—The trigger must be released at the end of each
strip, so that the sear will hold the piston at the cocked
position during the introduction of the following strip.
Otherwise, as soon as the feed piece is raised preparatory
to loading the breech will close, necessitating recocking
the gun before continuous firing.</p>

<p class='c005'>(7) Unloading.—In order to remove a partially spent
strip, proceed as follows:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>See that breech is open, cocking if necessary.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Hold claw of pawl free from strip by pushing upon lower extremity of feed piece with left 
    hand while withdrawing strip with right.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>N.B.—As a live cartridge never remains in the chamber
the mere presence or absence of the strip shows whether
the gun is loaded.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>RAPID CHANGE OF BARREL IN THE FIELD.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In prolonged firing it is sometimes desirable to replace
a hot barrel by a fresh one, so as to allow the former to
cool.</p>

<p class='c005'>This operation, which is performed without dismounting
any part of the mechanism, requires some 10 to 15 seconds.</p>

<p class='c005'>Proceed as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Suppose the gun in the firing position.</p>

<p class='c005'>The firer unscrews the locking nut one-sixth of a turn
with the right hand, using the dismounting wrench.</p>

<p class='c005'>While the second operator grasps the legs of the barrel
rest, quite near the barrel, No. 1 separates the barrel from
the receiver by drawing the latter to the rear.</p>

<p class='c005'>Resting the butt on the ground No. 1 now mounts the
fresh barrel and pushes it home.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meanwhile No. 2 handles the hot barrel by means of the
barrel rest, which he then detaches as follows:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Fold the legs.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Turn the legs forward until in line with the barrel.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Pivot the legs half a turn around the lug of the front sight carrier, thus permitting the 
    separation.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The fresh barrel being mounted, No. 2 attaches the
barrel rest and resets it.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hot barrel may be carried by means of dismounting
wrench.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>COOLING BARREL.</h3>

<p class='c014'>To reduce wear of rifling, the barrel should be kept
cool if circumstances allow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Water is not harmful, and when available may be
copiously applied to barrel by means of a sponge or rag.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hot barrel may be dipped in water, but all traces of
latter must be removed from barrel bore and gas cylinder,
by blowing through same, by means of cleaning rod, or
by firing two or three loose cartridges.</p>

<p class='c005'>Until all water is blown out of gas cylinder, the gas
pressure may be insufficient for ensuring automatic
action.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>USE OF THE REGULATOR.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In order that the working of the gun may be regular,
sufficient power must be available to ensure complete
recoil of the piston. The amount of power necessary
must vary because of insufficient oiling, dust, or fouling
in the mechanism, &#38;c. Then, again, pressure of the
powder gases may vary because of temperature, deteriorated
powder, or badly worn rifling.</p>

<p class='c005'>The regulator affords means of varying the power
which works the gun. Under normal conditions it should
be set at 25.</p>

<p class='c005'>To test the automatic action, fire several shots with
regulator set at 25 and cocking handle at “R,” and
observe:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>One shot should be fired at each pull of trigger. If more than one shot is fired at a 
    time, it shows that piston does not recoil sufficiently after each shot to catch on sear.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Claw of pawl should catch in the opening in strip at each shot. If pawl rides on top of 
    strip instead of catching, it shows that piston does not recoil sufficiently to throw 
    feed lever through a complete stroke.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The ejection should be regular and energetic.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>If these three points are not satisfactory it may be
concluded that there is a lack of power, and regulator
should be screwed up from 5 to 10 divisions.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the other hand, too much power is not desirable,
as the vibration due to the violent action of the mechanism
necessarily affects accuracy.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>ACCIDENTAL STOPPAGES IN THE AUTOMATIC ACTION OF THE GUN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In case of a jam always proceed as follows:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Open breech completely by means of cocking handle.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Remove jammed cartridge through ejection slot by using hand ejector or cleaning rod as 
    the case may be, and see that chamber is clear.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Withdraw the strip if some remedy is to be applied. Otherwise push it forward, bringing 
    the next cartridge to the loading position.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<h3 class='c016'>STOPPAGES AND THEIR REMEDIES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>(1) <b>Jam on the first round of a strip.</b></p>

<p class='c005'>The strip was probably not pushed completely home
before trigger was pulled. Always push forward strip
until pawl catches, so that both strip and cartridge are
positively held in loading position.</p>

<p class='c005'>(2) <b>Missfire.</b></p>

<p class='c005'>Eject defective cartridge by cocking gun, and continue
firing.</p>

<p class='c005'>N.B.—A loose primer falling into the mechanism may
cause repeated missfires. Dismount the piston and breech
block so as to remove primer, which will usually be found
either in the piston cams or in the fermeture nut near
the entrance to the chamber.</p>

<p class='c005'>Missfires may be also due to a weakened recoil spring.
In this case replace the spring with a spare.</p>

<p class='c005'>(3) <b>Bad introduction.</b></p>

<p class='c005'>The cartridge jams at entrance to the chamber when
being pushed forward by breech block. The bullet of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the cartridge in question may have been imperfectly
seated due to defective crimping, or the cartridge insufficiently
held by the clips of the feed strip.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the latter case the strip should be put aside for
re-sizing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another cause of bad introduction is incomplete feeding
due to lack of power. In this case screw up the regulator
3 to 10 divisions.</p>

<p class='c005'>(4) <b>Incomplete ejection of the spent cartridge case.</b></p>

<p class='c005'>This is due to lack of power. Screw up the regulator
5 to 10 divisions.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>CLEANING AND CARE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>This arm requires the same care as the service rifle.
It must be kept clean and free from rust, and all parts
lightly oiled. No gritty substances or emery should be
used.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon after firing as practicable the barrel should be
thoroughly cleaned and oiled, particular attention being
paid to the chamber.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gas cylinder should be kept free from fouling by
means of the cleaner so that the regulator can be easily
screwed up without using the dismounting wrench.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the gun is not in use the breech should be kept
closed so as to avoid weakening the recoil spring.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>FEED STRIPS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The feed strips hold 30 rounds each. There are three
rows of clips which hold the cartridge near the base, the
middle and at the neck. A stop lug which catches behind
the head of the cartridge case prevents longitudinal
motion.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>FEED STRIP FILLING MACHINE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The feed strip filling machine is constructed for clamping
to a bench or plank, as, for instance, the lid of a cartridge
box.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hopper and clamp are removable for compactness
in packing.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>The machine must be so placed that the crank can be
conveniently turned with the right hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Proceed as follows:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Fill the hopper with cartridges.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Push a feed strip, stop lugs to the rear, in its guides on the machine until the feed 
    tooth catches back of the first middle clip.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Turn the crank. At each complete turn of the crank first a cartridge is pushed forward 
    into the clips, and then the feed strip fed ahead one notch into position for the 
    succeeding cartridge.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>When filled remove the feed strip.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>This machine is operated most efficiently by two men.
One supplies the machine with feed strips, turns the crank,
and removes filled feed strips; the other supplies the
hopper with cartridges.</p>

<p class='c005'>N.B.—The feed strips may also be readily filled by
hand; care should be taken that the rims of all cartridges
bear back against their stop lugs.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>RE-SIZING THE FEED STRIPS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>When the feed strips have been used repeatedly, the
middle clips sometimes lose their curvature to such an
extent that the cartridges are not firmly held. This is
quickly remedied by passing the strips through the
re-sizing tool so as to restore the middle clips to their
original form.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a rule, very little re-sizing is necessary, slight contact
between the re-sizing roller and the top of the middle
clip sufficing.</p>

and 3 will reverse the actions of off-loading. The detachment
will then form up for marching.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>SECTION DRILL (WITHOUT TRANSPORT).</h3>

<p class='c014'>Guns, tripods and ammunition boxes will be placed on
the ground, muzzles to the front and in line, legs to rear,
straps round rear legs buckled, clamps sufficiently tight
to prevent legs from hanging loose when tripod is lifted.
Traversing clamp sufficiently loose to enable gun to be
deflected by a sharp tap with the hand on rear crosspiece,
guns on right and not closer to each other than
eight paces, ammunition boxes three paces in rear.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Fall in.</b>—Detachment for the two guns will “fall in”
in two ranks, five paces in front of the interval between
guns, sergeant on left of front rank, corporal covering
him in rear.</p>

<p class='c005'>Front rank will be right gun detachment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rear rank will be left gun detachment.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Number.</b>—As in squad drill.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Take Post.</b>—Detachments turn outwards and double
to their respective guns (sergeant and corporal on outer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>flanks, where they can superintend). Nos. 1 and 2 fall
in on left of tripod; No. 3 on left of ammunition box.
(If ground suitable these numbers should lie down.)</p>

<p class='c005'>Nos. 4, 5 and 6 fall in, in single rank, in rear of No. 3.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun position and point of aim is then indicated,
followed by command:—</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Mount Gun.</b>—No. 1 picks up tripod, having previously
seen that both elevating screws are exposed the same
distance, carries and places it in position indicated. In
adjusting, he must ensure that crosshead and sights are
upright, and legs clamped tight. No. 2 should so time his
advance that he will arrive immediately the tripod is
adjusted. He will carry gun to right side of tripod,
holding rear crosspiece with left hand, gun muzzle to
rear under right arm. Kneels on left knee, facing tripod,
and supporting weight of gun on right knee, places it
on tripod, drives in and turns down crosshead joint pin,
and removes cork plug from steam escape hole.</p>

<p class='c005'>No. 1 fixes elevating joint pin and directs gun towards
the mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>No. 2 kneeling and placing ammunition box in position.</p>

<p class='c005'>No. 3 when he sees gun nearly mounted, will carry
ammunition box forward and place it within reach of
No. 2. He then retires to a position not immediately
in rear of the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Load.</b>—No. 1 raises tangent sight, No. 2 passes tag of
belt through feed block. No. 1 turns crank handle on
to buffer spring, pulls belt to left front as far as it will
go, and lets go crank handle, releases strain on belt,
then turns crank handle on to buffer spring, again pulls
belt to left front and lets go belt and crank handle. The
gun is now ready to fire.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Single Shot Loading.</b>—Carry out first half of loading
motions, then, without touching belt, turn crank handle
on to buffer spring and let go.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>800 (Range).</b>—No. 1 repeats the order and adjusts
slide to elevation required.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>At (Object).</b>—No. 2 adjusts traversing clamp if ordered
to by No. 1, who lays the gun, raises automatic safety
catch with forefinger and prepares to fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>When No. 1 is ready No. 2 holds up his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Fire.</b>—No. 1 presses the double button.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span><b>Cease Fire.</b>—No. 1 releases automatic safety catch and
remains steady.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Traversing Fire.</b>—No. 1 will lay gun on flank named,
press button, and tap alternately, with the hand, on the
rear crosspiece in the required direction, until limit is
reached.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Unload.</b>—No. 1 lowers the sight (not the slide), turns
the crank handle twice in succession on to buffer spring,
letting it fly back each time on to the check lever; then
presses up finger pieces on bottom pawls, No. 2 withdrawing
and repacking belt in box. No. 1 clears ejector
tube and lock, and releases lock spring by pressing double
button.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Dismount Gun.</b>—No. 1 removes crosshead and elevating
joint pins. No. 2 replaces cork plug, passes ammunition
box to No. 3, and removes gun to its original position
in rear, No. 1 following with tripod, joint pins will then be
pushed home, legs folded and clamped.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Prone Position.</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>Mount Gun.</b>—No. 1 crawls into position, pushing tripod
forward with right hand, having first adjusted front legs
by turning it over and moving legs round so that they
remain in a slightly backward position over the elevating
wheel.</p>

<p class='c005'>When in the position ordered for mounting, he turns
legs down and adjusts so as to secure a low, upright
position of the crosshead.</p>

<p class='c005'>No. 2 will then move into position, on his back, carrying
the gun across his body, muzzle to the front. On reaching
tripod he will push muzzle towards No. 1 who will assist
in mounting, and insert crosshead joint pin, No. 2 inserting
elevating joint pin and removing cork plug.</p>

<p class='c005'>No. 1 will then turn into position for firing, supporting
himself against the legs of No. 2.</p>

<p class='c005'>Adjust sights, load, and fire as ordered.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Out of Action.</b>—No. 1 will unload, Nos. 1 and 2 (in
prone position) will take hold of rear leg (No. 1 with right
hand, No, 2 with left), and draw gun out of action until
under cover, when gun will be dismounted in the usual
manner; No. 2 having drawn ammunition box back with
the gun.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>CHARACTERISTICS OF MACHINE GUN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The fact that the gun is mounted upon a platform and
the personal factor thus reduced, results in a close
grouping of fire, and practically the same results are
obtained in war as in peace, the beaten zone being about
half the area of that of rifle fire. This gives the following
advantages:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Surprise effect.</p>

<p class='c025'>Observation of fire for ranging.</p>

<p class='c025'>Overhead covering fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Other advantages of the machine gun are:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Narrow frontage (a machine gun only occupying
the same frontage as two infantrymen).</p>

<p class='c025'>Difficult to locate.</p>

<p class='c025'>Normal rate of fire about 500 rounds per minute.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>All-round traverse, which allows gun to be turned
in any direction without moving tripod, and with
little exposure.</p>

<p class='c025'>Mobility: It can go wherever a man can go on
foot.</p>

<p class='c005'>It has, however, the following drawbacks:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Overheating, and consequent stoppage through too
prolonged fire.</p>

<p class='c025'>Noise of firing, and steam from barrel casing
reveals position.</p>

<p class='c025'>Narrow and scattered objects are unsuitable targets.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>It will be seen therefore that the machine gun is
a weapon of opportunity particularly adapted for
surprise effect, but not for sustained fire action.</b></p>

<h3 class='c016'>FIRE DIRECTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The following methods should be used:—</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Ranging Fire.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Bursts of fire limited to from 10 to 20 rounds.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is unlikely that observation will be obtained with
larger bursts.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Rapid Fire.</h4>

<p class='c014'>In groups of from 30 to 50 rounds, the firer pausing
slightly between each group to confirm the alignment
of sights.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Traversing Fire.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Distributed laterally, and applied in a series of small
groups, the object being to cover as wide a front as
possible, with a minimum of volume. (Groups should
consist of from 5 to 10 rounds only.) A belt of 250 rounds
should cover a frontage of 25 yards in one minute.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Swinging Traverse.</h4>

<p class='c014'>For trench warfare, and against dense targets at close
ranges, the traversing clamp being kept fairly loose and
the gun traversed evenly and smoothly from side to side,
both hands retaining their hold on the traversing handles.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Combined Sights.</h4>

<p class='c014'>When two or more guns are working together, the depth
of the effective zone can be increased by ordering different
elevations for each gun, both, however, using the same
point of aim.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The respective depth and width of effective zones may
be taken as being:—</p>

<p class='c005'>From this it is apparent that, allowing an error of
10 per cent. in ascertaining the range, the flatness of
trajectory within 800 yards will insure the target being
included in the effective zone, therefore with Mark VII
ammunition combined sights should not be used at less
than 800 yards.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Bracketing.</h4>

<p class='c014'>When only a section is available and the “combined
sights” method does not give sufficient assurance
of fire effect, “bracketing” should be used as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>The range estimated, probable error determined, and
the limits between which it is necessary to search with
fire, the maximum and minimum elevation will be allotted
to right and left gun respectively, who fire a burst and
then work inwards (one higher, one lower) by altering
their respective elevations 50 yards each time, eventually
passing each other. If observation of the fire can be
obtained, correct elevation should be immediately ordered.</p>

<p class='c005'>With Mark VII ammunition this method would not be
necessary at 1,000 yards, as with a 10 per cent. error the
“combined sights” method would give a satisfactory result.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Vertical Searching.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The range to nearest point of objective is taken, sight
adjusted and gun laid on this point.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sights are then set for the farthest point of the objective.
This will bring the line of sight short of the aiming-point.
A series of bursts are then fired, care being taken
that each burst strikes just beyond the former one, but
does not leave any gap between groups.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Overhead Fire.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Can be employed normally from or at a commanding
position, or across a valley, but not when own troops
and those of the enemy are on same plane.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Range of target must be accurate. If 1,000 yards or
under, angles of sight to enemy and own troops must not
be less than 30 minutes. If range is between 1,000 and
1,500 yards, the angle must not be less than 60 mins.</p>

<p class='c005'>Overhead fire should not be used at 1,500 yards and over.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following method of sighting can be used.—</p>

<p class='c005'>Adjust backsight to correct range of target and lay
gun on mark. If gun is nearer than 900 yards, raise
sight by 400 yards, and if further than 900 yards, raise
sight 250 yards.</p>

<p class='c005'>The new line of sight gives safety angles.</p>

<p class='c005'>When heads of own troops come into line of sight,
cease fire, or continue to elevate gradually, keeping pace
with advance.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Indirect Fire.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Firing from concealed positions at an auxiliary aiming
mark.</p>

<p class='c005'>A machine gun protractor, or graticules cut across the
focal plane of prismatic glasses are most satisfactory. By
this means indirect fire can be applied as easily as direct fire.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Night Firing.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The gun may be laid by day and left until required, or
by use of the “night firing box,” as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>A stick is placed in the ground 10 yards in front of gun
in a direct line with the target, and at night the stick is
replaced by the “night firing box”—the sights altered (but
not the gun) until aligned on the lamp at the point where
the lines form the true centre.</p>

<p class='c005'>Searching and deflection can be satisfactorily carried
out with this apparatus.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fire (signalled).</p>

<p class='c025'>The same method is employed when laying on the

<h3 class='c016'>SIGNALS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>In many cases observation will be impossible from
the gun position and it will be necessary for observers to
signal results from a flank.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>The following semaphore code is used in signalling the
results of observation of fire:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>P—</dt>
    <dd>Plus: meaning fire observed at least 50 yards beyond target.
    </dd>
    <dt>M—</dt>
    <dd>Minus: meaning fire observed at least 50 yards short of target.
    </dd>
    <dt>T—</dt>
    <dd>Right: meaning fire observed to right of target.
    </dd>
    <dt>C—</dt>
    <dd>Centre: meaning direction of fire correct.
    </dd>
    <dt>U—</dt>
    <dd>Unobserved: meaning no observation obtained.
    </dd>
    <dt>Q—</dt>
    <dd>Query: meaning fire observed, but its position uncertain.
    </dd>
    <dt>R—</dt>
    <dd>Range: meaning range correct.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>The signaller at the observation post should give the
“call up” to show that the observers are ready. “P”
and “M” may be repeated for multiples of 50 yards;
thus, “PP” would mean, “Fire observed at least 100
yards beyond target.” Signals should be repeated from
the gun position if this can be done without disclosing the
position to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>On all occasions when guns are firing, the following
signals should be used in controlling fire:—</p>

<p class='c005'>Signal for “Action.”—Both arms fully extended, raised
from the sides to a position in line with the shoulders and
lowered again. This motion to be repeated until it is seen
that the signal is being complied with. Note.—A
machine gun is said to be “In Action” when it is mounted,
loaded and laid, but not necessarily firing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Signal for “Out of Action.” Arm swung in a circular
motion in front of the body.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>By No. 2.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Hand up—Gun ready to open fire.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>By Controlling Officer.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Hand u— Preparatory to opening fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand dropped—Open fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Elbow close to the side, forearm waved horizontally—Cease
fire.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Part I.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>1. <span class='sc'>Additional Practice.</span>—For trench warfare, and
against dense targets at close range, the “Swinging
Traverse” has been found necessary. It in no way replaces
the method of traversing by automatic tapping, which
should still be considered the normal method. The
swinging traverse is taught by teaching a man to traverse
a machine gun instructional target evenly and smoothly
in about 6 seconds.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Part II.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>2. <span class='sc'>Practice 10.</span>—It will be necessary to shorten the
target, as 40 rounds less are allowed for in this practice.
This will be done by using two 10–feet screens instead of
three. Spaces will be 20 inches.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. <span class='sc'>Practice 13.</span>—(<i>a</i>) If a field firing range is not available
Practice 11 will be substituted for this practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>b</i>) Observation should be taken by three parties, left,
right, and centre, who should change round after each firer.
Section Officers should ascertain that each man has
observed from each position.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. <span class='sc'>Practice 14.</span>—10 rounds will be fired at each of the
four distances from 600 yds. to 200 yds. on the lines laid
down in Musketry Regulations. These rounds will be
“spaced out” before commencing the practice, and the
firer will proceed to the next range on completing his 10
rounds, whether he has secured a hit or not.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Classification.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>5. Machine gunners will be classified upon the result
which they obtain in Practices 9 and 10, General Machine
Gun Course, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>To be classified as a “1st Class Gunner” 50 points.</p>

<p class='c005'>To be classified as a “Qualified Gunner” 25 points.</p>

<p class='c005'>Points will be allotted in the classification practices on
the same basis of scoring as laid down in paragraph 647,
Musketry Regulations, Part I., 1909 (reprint), 1914.</p>

<p class='c005'>Preliminary instruction in aiming and firing should be
given by means of a <b>Rifle Attachment</b>.</p>

<p class='c005'>A very satisfactory one can be obtained at small
cost from Messrs. A. G. Parker &#38; Co., Whittall Street,
Birmingham.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<img src='images/i_b_099.jpg' alt='[Clamps]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The illustration is practically self-explanatory. The
large round clamps fit on the water jacket of the machine
gun and the small clamps hold the rifle, which can be
adjusted to hit at exactly the same mark as the machine
gun barrel is aimed at.</p>

<p class='c005'>The trigger of the rifle is connected to the machine gun
by the adjustable chain device shown.</p>

<p class='c005'>The apparatus is in constant use at the Schools of
Musketry, and is the invention of Armourer Sergeant-Major
Hiscock, of the Motor Machine Gun Section.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c015'>Choice of Gun Positions.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The choice of a gun position must be governed by the
following considerations:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Enfilade fire, against the enemy and against ourselves.</div>

      <div class='line'>Long-range fire, against enemy’s supports.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fire against houses, etc., in rear of enemy’s line.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fire against likely places for enemy’s machine guns.</div>
      <div class='line'>Concealment from enemy’s artillery.</div>
      <div class='line'>Alternative positions.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lines of advance and retreat.</div>
      <div class='line'>Covered approach for ammunition carriers, etc.</div>
      <div class='line'>Facilities for control of guns.</div>
      <div class='line'>Avoid:—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Obvious positions.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Positions easy to describe.     } Either from surroundings</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Positions easy to arrange upon. }   or maps.</div>
      <div class='line'>Positions near prominent objects or aiming-points.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ground which will facilitate observation of fire by the enemy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c015'>Employment of Machine Guns.</h4>

<p class='c014'>The fire of well-concealed machine guns may often be
directed against:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Windows, doors, roofs, etc., of houses thought to
be occupied.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Areas of bush, crops, etc.</p>

<p class='c025'>Open spaces across which the enemy are dribbling
in small parties in order to concentrate at another
point.</p>

<p class='c025'>The enemy’s firing-line.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may happen that machine guns are forced to open
fire in self-defence, or to assist the advance of the infantry
in spite of the target offered not being a suitable one for
machine guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Any tendency, however, to open fire with machine guns
without good reason must be suppressed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Machine Guns and Artillery.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Every effort must be made to prevent machine guns
being located by artillery.</p>

<p class='c005'>If guns are shelled they must either:—</p>

<p class='c025'><b>Change their Position at once.</b>—This would be
the usual proceeding. A movement of quite
a short distance—say 50 yards—is quite sufficient
in many cases; or—</p>

<p class='c025'><b>Cease fire while detachments take cover until
the shelling stops.</b>—If this be done, the hostile
artillery may think that the machine guns have
been put out of action.</p>

<p class='c025'>Good targets may then present themselves, and the
guns may be able to reopen fire with good effect
from the same position.</p>

<p class='c025'>There have been several cases of machine guns
firing against artillery with great success. The
following instances are quoted:—</p>

<p class='c025'>(<i>a</i>) A section of machine guns worked forward to
a concealed position 900 yards away from a
German field battery in action. The section
brought oblique fire to bear on the battery and
completely silenced it.</p>

<p class='c025'>(<i>b</i>) A section took a German field battery in enfilade
at 2,400 yards. The battery was firing at the
time, the gunners fled from their guns, and the
battery was silenced.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Frontal fire by machine guns against shielded
artillery can only be expected to produce moral effect.
This moral effect may, however, be considerable; and, in
addition, the machine gun fire may greatly hamper the
supply of ammunition to the guns, etc.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>The Occupation of Various Positions by Machine Guns.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'><b>Barricades.</b>—When barricading roads, bridges, streets,
etc., machine guns should not be placed on the barricade
itself if equally good effect can be obtained by placing
the guns in positions commanding the approaches to the
barricade.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Banks.</b>—The banks of rivers, canals, streams, etc.,
can be made use of for gun positions, or covered lines of
advance or retreat.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Crops.</b>—Standing crops often form useful cover for
guns and concealed lines of advance, etc.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Ditches.</b>—These can often be used to enable machine
guns to be pushed forward, so as to bring oblique or
enfilade fire to bear on the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Great care must be taken not to show above the banks
of the ditch.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few men should be pushed along the ditch on the
exposed flank as a protection against snipers, counterattacks,
etc.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Houses.</b>—Houses may be used as follows:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Place the gun in the back of a room, firing through
an open window, or a window from which a few
panes of glass have been removed.</p>

<p class='c025'>Remove a few tiles from the roof, and fire through
the opening thus made.</p>

<p class='c025'>Should a house have two doors or two windows,
directly behind one another, the gun may be
placed in rear of the house, and fire through
these doors or windows.</p>

<p class='c025'>Place the gun in rear of the house, so that oblique
or enfilade fire can be brought to bear on the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c025'>If the house possesses a cellar, the gun may be
placed in the cellar, a few bricks being removed,
so as to enable the gun to be fired from the
ground-level.</p>

<p class='c025'>In whatever position the gun is placed some protection
should, if possible, be provided for the
numbers, such as an emplacement of sandbags,
stones, bricks, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>It should be remembered that if the gun is located in
a building by the enemy’s artillery, it may be necessary
to evacuate the building quickly; arrangements must
therefore be made to meet this contingency.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Folds in the Ground.</b>—Great use can be made of
folds in the ground for the concealment of machine guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>The gun should be placed so as to enable the bullets
to clear the crest, while the gun and detachment are
concealed as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Haystacks.</b>—These can be made use of as follows:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Hollow out front of haystack.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 1 sits in this hollow, with his back against
the hay.</p>

<p class='c025'>The loose hay is piled up in front of the gun.</p>

<p class='c025'>Cut out a place for the gun on top of the haystack.</p>

<p class='c025'>If possible, make a rough platform of boards.</p>

<p class='c025'>The gun then fires over the top of the ridge of
the stack.</p>

<p class='c025'>Place the gun behind the haystack in such a manner
that oblique or enfilade fire may be brought
to bear on the enemy.</p>

<p class='c025'>The gun is then entirely concealed from the
front.</p>

<p class='c025'>This is, as a rule, the best method of using
a haystack.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Hedges.</b>—Can often be used as a covered approach and
as fire positions giving cover from view.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few men should be placed along the hedge, on the
exposed flank, for protection.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>Mounds of Earth, Roots, etc.</b>—These may be used as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Hollow out the mound from the rear, so that the
gun can fire from the hollow while it is concealed
from the front.</p>
<p class='c034'>Planks, sandbags, etc., can be used to support
the earth.</p>
<p class='c025'>Fire over the top of the mound, using the mound
as a parapet.</p>

<p class='c025'>Place the gun behind the mound, using the mound
as a cover from the front, while oblique or enfilade
fire is brought to bear against the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span><b>Stacks of Wood.</b>—The stack may be hollowed out
from the rear, so that the gun can be placed inside the
stack, and fire to the front, while being perfectly concealed
from view.</p>

<p class='c005'>The position can be strengthened by using sandbags
inside the stack.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Stooks of Corn</b> can also be used to provide cover from
view.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Trees.</b>—Trees, when in leaf, may be used as possible
gun positions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Trees with strong branches are necessary, and a platform
for the gun must be built in the branches.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tree-trunks can also be used to provide cover from
view.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Trenches.</b>—When guns are not used in trenches they
should, when possible, be placed so as to bring oblique or
enfilade fire against:—</p>

<p class='c025'>The enemy’s trenches.</p>

<p class='c025'>The ground over which the enemy must pass,
should he attack.</p>

<p class='c025'>Our own front line trenches in case the enemy
penetrates into them.</p>

<p class='c005'>To achieve these objects guns may be placed:—</p>

<p class='c025'>In a salient.</p>

<p class='c025'>At the base of a re-entrant.</p>

<p class='c025'>At the horns of a re-entrant.</p>

<p class='c025'>At a bend in the trench.</p>

<p class='c025'>In an emplacement jutting out from the general
line of the trench.</p>

<p class='c005'>In all cases the gun should, if possible, be covered from
fire from the front, and should be able to sweep the front
of the entrenched line with cross fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus, although each gun may be firing to its flank, its
front is swept by the fire of a neighbouring gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arrangements should be made so that guns so placed
may be able to fire to their front, should an emergency
make this desirable.</p>

<p class='c005'>This can be done by:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Arranging that some sandbags can be removed and
the gun fired to the front through the loophole
thus made.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>In this connection it must be remembered that:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>If the sandbags are left in place for a considerable time without being removed, they may 
    become embedded and be found unmovable.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>That loopholes filled with single sacks will not be bullet-proof.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>Training the gunners to:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Remove the gun quickly from the tripod and fire from the top of parapet without it.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Lift the gun and tripod out of the trench and fire it from some previously selected spot.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Both these methods require much practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every endeavour should be made to conceal the position
of the gun from the front.</p>

<p class='c005'>Gun emplacements must therefore be made to appear
exactly like the remainder of the trench or breastwork.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several emplacements should be made for each gun, and
practice should be made in moving guns quickly from one
emplacement to another.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Guns may be placed</b>—<span class='sc'>In the Front Line of
Trenches.</span>—This may be taken as the general rule.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>In Support Trenches.</span>—There are occasions when it
may be advisable to place guns in the support trenches.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here they may be arranged so as to:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Prevent a further advance of the enemy should they
capture the front line.</p>

<p class='c025'>Enfilade the front line should it be captured.</p>

<p class='c025'>Sweep the communication trenches.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>In Positions in Rear.</span>—If the ground is favourable it
may be possible to place guns, in concealed positions, in
rear of the entrenched line.</p>

<p class='c005'>They can be arranged so as to:—</p>

<p class='c025'>Fire over the trenches and sweep the ground in
front.</p>

<p class='c025'>Fire through gaps in the defensive line.</p>

<p class='c025'>Command positions where the enemy may concentrate
prior to the assault.</p>

<p class='c025'>Command positions likely to be occupied by the
enemy’s machine guns.</p>

<p class='c025'>Command covered approaches on the defensive
line.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Enable guns to fire on enemy’s trenches with
greater effect.</p>

<p class='c025'>Give overhead covering fire in case of an advance
by our own troops.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>General Notes on Trench Work.</h4>

<p class='c014'>If guns are often used, the positions from which they are
fired should frequently be changed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the enemy may be deceived as to the number and
position of the guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Emplacements should be numbered, and range cards
placed in each.</p>

<p class='c005'>When taking over a line of trenches the machine gun
officer must make careful arrangements for controlling
the fire of his guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>The machine gun officer must:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Establish himself at a place where he can always be found.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Keep in touch with his guns with the officers of the line of trenches he is assisting to 
    defend.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Arrange for ammunition supply.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Arrange for reliefs.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'><b>Towers, windmills and other high buildings</b> may
often be used with advantage:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>For overhead fire.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Cover the advance of friendly troops.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Fire at attacking enemy over the heads of our own troops.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Enable fire to be directed into enemy’s trenches.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>To direct the fire of guns situated in other positions.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'><b>Woods</b>, especially when in leaf, are often most valuable
for concealing the position of guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Care must be taken that the guns are not placed too
near the edge of the wood or individual men expose
themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>All communications between guns should be made in
the wood, well in rear of the guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alternative positions should be selected, so that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>guns may be moved rapidly from one to another if desired,
with as little loss of time as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lines of retirement through the woods must be arranged
and also lines of communication between guns and limbers
thought out.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>Machine Guns in Action.</h4>

<p class='c014'><b>The Attack.</b>—The guns should be dug in whenever it
is possible to do so without giving away their position.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is often impossible to see anything of the enemy.
Therefore likely positions for him to occupy must be
looked for.</p>

<p class='c005'>Surprise, obtained by a concealed advance, is essential
to the successful handling of machine guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>The progress of the infantry must be carefully watched,
with a view to pushing on a certain number of guns and
to closely support them whenever possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>The usual methods of supporting the infantry attack
will be:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Fire from the flanks.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Overhead fire.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Long-range searching fire.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Fire from a forward position.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>Every opportunity for the use of overhead fire should
be seized.</p>

<p class='c005'>All suitable ground, buildings, etc., that may enable this
kind of fire to be used should be looked for.</p>

<p class='c005'>The enemy’s machine guns are the weapons that are
most likely to hold up the attack.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore every effort should be made to locate them,
and to concentrate the fire of our own machine guns upon
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may sometimes be possible to use machine guns to
search systematically all places in the area of attack likely
to be held by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>This searching fire has undoubtedly considerable moral
effect on the troops subjected to it, and may greatly assist
the subsequent infantry advance. It requires, however,
a large expenditure of ammunition.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the preliminary reconnaissance is properly carried
out, it is quite possible for the guns employed for this
purpose to remain undetected, even though pushed well
forward.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The general rules as to position of machine guns in
attack are as follows:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>The fire of a large proportion of the available guns should be carefully organized to 
    cover the infantry advance.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>This covering fire is no longer possible, move up a proportion of the available guns 
    either into, or on to, the flanks of the infantry firing-line.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>A proportion of the guns should usually be held back as a reserve in the hands of the 
    commander.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Thus each gun has a definite duty to perform, and co-operation between guns is assured.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>It may be possible, and advantageous, to move forward
a proportion of the guns with the attacking lines of the
infantry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The guns allotted to this duty will not take part in the
covering fire, but will keep themselves fresh and their
ammunition intact, in readiness for the advance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their duties will be to:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Help the infantry to gain fire superiority at the decisive point.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Make good and hold positions won.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Pursue the enemy by fire.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Watch for and repel counterattacks.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>e</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Enable the infantry to re-organize.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c005'>As enemy snipers are a particular source of annoyance
to machine gunners, they should be watched for.</p>

<p class='c005'>The defence of prepared positions has been already
dealt with under the heading of Machine Guns in Trenches.</p>

<p class='c005'>Machine guns in any defensive position must be so
organized that they can support each other mutually
throughout any given section of the defensive line.</p>

<p class='c005'>It must be remembered that the best positions for
machine guns are not always the same by night and day.</p>

<p class='c005'>It will often be necessary to move the guns from the
night position to the day position before dawn.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Rearguard Action.</b>—The following points must be considered:—</p>

<p class='c025'>A wide field of fire.</p>

<p class='c025'>Guns must be carefully concealed in the least
obvious places.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Covered lines of retreat must be carefully reconnoitred.</p>

<p class='c025'>Limbers must be close up, to facilitate hasty
retirement.</p>

<p class='c025'>Positions in rear must be chosen before the guns
leave the position they are holding.</p>

<p class='c025'>A proportion of the guns should occupy the position
in rear, before all guns retire from the forward
position, thus the retirement of the last guns can
be covered.</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Village Fighting.</b>—As soon as the infantry have made
good one edge of the village, the guns will be brought up
as close to the firing-line as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>They will then search windows, doorways, roofs, etc.,
likely to be held by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Guns will be used to command cross-streets, etc., so as
to guard against attacks on the flanks or rear of the
infantry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Guns should also be posted on the edges of the village,
to prevent flank attacks.</p>

<p class='c005'>During village fighting every use should be made of
windows, doors, etc., as machine gun positions (see
page <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>).</p>

<p class='c005'><b>Co-operation.</b>—The necessity for co-operation between
the machine guns taking part in any particular
action cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not only should the individual gun of a particular unit
work upon some definite plan for mutual support, but the
sections of all units that are operating together should
co-operate with a view to obtaining the best results from
their combined action.</p>

<p class='c005'>This cannot be done in action unless it has been previously
practised.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore great attention should be paid to training
a number of guns to operate together for some specific
purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The following notes from overseas on machine guns,
compiled by Capt. E. Feilder (Attached Gen. Staff,
A.T.C.), are of considerable value:—</p>

<h3 class='c016'>INSTRUCTIONS FOR MACHINE GUN OFFICER.</h3>

<p class='c014'>1. The Machine Gun Officer should have a complete
knowledge of the nature of the action and the plans of the
Commander.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The Commanding Officer should inform the M.G.
Officer generally of the part he expects the guns to play,
and the particular assistance he requires from him.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. The M.G. Officer should then be allowed to form and
carry out his own plan of action in such a way as best
meets the requirements of the C.O. and the situation
generally.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. When possible, ample time should be given the M.G.
Officer to make his arrangements.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. He should not be given hurried orders at the last
moment; such a proceeding is very seldom necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>SUGGESTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE MACHINE GUNS OF A BRIGADE TAKING PART IN AN ATTACK ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>1. The whole of the machine guns must be organised
under the command of one Officer.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. This Officer, in conjunction with the Section Officers,
must make detailed plans for the employment of the guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. In this manner each gun or group of guns will have a
specific task allotted to it. Before the action commences
all concerned will thoroughly understand their duties.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. It must be clearly understood by all Officers of the
Brigade that the machine guns have definite tasks allotted
to them. That they are under the command of the Brigade
Machine Gun Officer, and are therefore not to be given
orders or otherwise interfered with by other Officers.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. The plans of the B.M.G.O. will have been made in
consultation with the Brigade Commander, who will have
explained to him the course that the action is expected to
take.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>All guns must be in their allotted places before the
preliminary bombardment commences.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. The Machine Guns will be allotted as follows:—</p>

<h4 class='c015'>A.—<b>Some to go forward with the Attacking Infantry.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>These guns should not open fire until the infantry advance takes place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their role will be to make good the ground gained by
the infantry against counter attack.</p>

<p class='c005'>They should advance in such a manner as to ensure their
reaching the position gained by the infantry in safety.</p>

<p class='c005'>The locality in which the guns will be mounted in the
captured lines should be settled before the advance.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>B.—<b>Some to Cover the Infantry Advance.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>The possibility of using guns for this purpose and their
positions if used depends on:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The lie of the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The position of your own and the enemy’s trenches.</p>

<p class='c005'>When their role of covering fire is completed they should
automatically come again under the control of the
B.M.G.O., who will give them further orders.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>C.—<b>Some Detailed in Pairs to Engage the Enemy’s Machine Guns when these are Located.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>These may possibly go forward with the attacking Infantry. This will depend on the nature of the ground, action, etc.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>D.—<b>Some in Reserve under the Brigade Commander.</b></h4>

<p class='c014'>These should be retained as a real reserve and not
pushed too early into the fight.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the attack is to consist of more than one phase, that
is to say, of two or more distinct advances, separate
plans must be made for each.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arrangements for the supply of ammunition, belt fittings,
ammunition depôts, etc., must be made before the action
commences. One Officer should be placed in charge of
these arrangements.</p>

<p class='c005'>The B.M.G.O. should remain with the Brigadier. He
should provide himself with a suitable number of orderlies.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>CO-OPERATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The necessity for co-operation between the machine
guns taking part in any particular action cannot be overestimated.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not only should the individual guns of a particular unit
work upon some definite plan for mutual support, but the
sections of all units that are operating together should
co-operate with a view to obtaining the best results from
their combined actions. This cannot be done in action
unless previously practised. Therefore attention should
be paid to training numbers of guns to operate together
for some specific purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>RANGES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The ranges fired at have varied from 15 yards (at which,
in one instance, a German rush was stopped), to 2,800 yds.,
at which range a battery of the enemy’s field artillery was
silenced. This brings out the importance of:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The allowance for wind at long ranges.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The importance of range-taking, range cards, judging
distance, visual training, reference points, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Practice of the “Swinging Traverse” for stopping
rushes and dealing with dense targets at very close range.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Practice of traversing by means of the “Automatic
Tap” for medium and long ranges.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>NATURE OF TARGETS FIRED AT.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Targets have been of all kinds, such as:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Dense masses at all ranges.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Extended lines at all ranges.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Artillery on the move and in action.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Edges of woods, hedges, ditches, etc., where enemy’s
firing-line was known to be, but in many cases could not
be seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. Enemy machine guns in all manner of positions,
usually invisible to the eye or even with glasses.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. Hollows, wood, and other cover under which the
enemy was known to be concentrating.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. Searching fire to try and locate and beat down hostile
fire that was being delivered from concealed positions.</p>

<p class='c005'>The varied nature of the targets that the machine gunner
may have to engage brings out the fact that the machine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>gunner must be very thoroughly trained, and emphasizes
the points brought out under “Ranges, Fire Orders,
Indication and Recognition.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>FIRE ORDERS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>While in a large number of instances it has been possible
to give fire orders by word of mouth, this will, as a rule,
be only possible under exceptionally favourable circumstances.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the successful co-operation of the guns working
under one leader will very largely depend on the mutual
understanding that exists between the Officer and his Gun
Commanders.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore the Officer must ensure that all those under
him clearly understand:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The part the machine guns are intended to play.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The plans of the Machine Gun Officer.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. The objects in view and the methods by which the
Machine Gun Officer hopes to attain them.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this way, even when individual control by the Officer
has been lost, the desired effect will most likely be obtained,
for each Gun Commander will be striving to attain that
effect, though, perhaps, by different means.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>METHODS EMPLOYED IN CONTROLLING FIRE OF SECTION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The following have been the usual methods:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Fire orders by word of mouth.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Signals (including flashlights, etc.).</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Telephones (in one or two cases in trenches).</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Orderlies.</p>

<p class='c005'>But whatever method is employed, a thorough understanding
between the Officer and those under him is
essential.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>NUMBER OF GUNS UNDER ONE COMMAND.</h3>

<p class='c014'>One Officer to a 4–Gun Section is not sufficient. Whether
the guns are grouped under the supreme command of one
Senior Officer, or whether they work in sections, there
should always be one Officer to each pair of guns.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>ALTERNATIVE POSITIONS ARRANGED FOR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The great importance of alternative positions being
arranged for cannot be overestimated. The best way
of moving the gun from one position to another without
being seen should be studied. If guns are located and
shelled, either:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Move guns at once to an alternative position or right
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Let the gunners cease fire and get under cover until
the shelling ceases.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first will be the more useful proceeding, but success
has been obtained several times with the second. For
example:—</p>

<p class='c005'>On one occasion, after shelling for some time, the artillery
ceased, thinking, no doubt, that they had “knocked out”
the machine guns. Massed enemy infantry then advanced,
the machine guns opening fire again from their old position
with great effect.</p>

<p class='c005'>The great importance of concealed approach in occupying
positions must be impressed on Machine Gun Officers.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>GENERAL REMARKS OF INTEREST.</h3>

<p class='c014'>1. Lack of any organised method of using machine guns.
Young and inexperienced Officers are left in many cases
to do what they think best with their sections, without
any previous consultation or plan as to how guns can be
most usefully employed.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Lack of any attempt at co-operation between the
sections of the units working together in any particular
action.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Lack of initiative and push. This is usually due to
want of knowledge. Though the machine gun is a weapon
of opportunity, opportunities seldom occur to those who
passively await them.</p>

<p class='c005'>A good Machine Gun Officer, by keeping himself
thoroughly in touch with the situation, must have an
opportunity to use his guns with effect.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. This lack of co-operation is seen both in the open
and in trench work. All this points to the fact that co-operation
between the whole of the machine guns taking
part in any action is not sufficiently studied.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>GUNS BRIGADED IN ACTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>On many of the occasions brought to notice in which
machine guns have been brigaded they have achieved
marked success, but on the whole not sufficient use has
been made of this method of obtaining the combined
action of a number of guns.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Brigading” guns does not mean “massing” them.
It means the “brigaded” guns are employed with some
definite plan under the direction of one Officer.</p>

<p class='c005'>In all cases where the action of brigade guns has been
successful there has been:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. A thorough understanding of the plans of the Brigadier
by the B.M.G.O.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Conference between the B.M.G.O. and the Section
Officers at which the arrangements for the employment
of the machine guns were fully discussed.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Definite orders to the Section Officers.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. A proportion of the guns held in reserve under the
B.M.G.O.</p>

<p class='c005'>But when the sections have been hastily collected
together and placed under the B.M.G.O., without time
for making the above arrangements, the result has usually
been that sections have been dispersed without definite
orders or a complete understanding of the situation, and
effect has been lost.</p>

<p class='c005'>In trench warfare the successful co-operation of the
machine guns assisting in the defence of any particular
section of the entrenched line has been obtained by:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. A previous reconnaissance of the whole line by the
B.M.G.O.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. Diagrams made of own and enemy’s trenches.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. The number of emplacements.</p>

<p class='c005'>This has enabled rapid concentration of the requisite
number of guns only on any one portion of the enemy’s
line, and has prevented unnecessary opening of fire and
the consequent waste of ammunition.</p>

<p class='c005'>In many cases, however, Officers in command of troops
in sections of trench line have considered they are also
in command of the machine guns placed in that portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of the trench occupied by their troops. This has led
to:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The disadvantage of dual control.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The guns being placed in the same emplacement day
after day.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. The arrangements of Machine Gun Officer being
interfered with.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. The guns being located by the enemy through an
unnecessary opening of fire ordered by an Officer who is
not an expert in machine gun tactics.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>FIRE ORDERS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The system of fire orders as taught at Hythe previous
to the war has been most successful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Machine Gun Officers are also of opinion that, though
it has often been impossible to give orders by word of
mouth, the systematic training of all ranks in this system
tends to ease of control under difficult circumstances,
and when a number of guns are being employed for
combined action.</p>

<p class='c005'>This training forms a basis from which other methods
of control can most easily be evolved, and inculcates
into the men the necessity for assuring themselves that
any orders received by them are passed on by some means
to those concerned.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>“INDICATION AND RECOGNITION.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>The methods of “indication and recognition,” as taught
at Hythe before the war, have proved most useful. This
fact has been brought out in the accounts of the most
successful machine gun actions, as has also the great
value of the use of range cards and indication points.
Targets are generally easy to indicate, as men are more
alert than in peace-time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Training in indication, recognition, fire orders, and
judging distance, can be given at any time, as no apparatus
is required.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is also valuable, as it trains all ranks in a quick
understanding of directions given, study of ground, and
trains the eye in quick observation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>WORKING GUNS IN PAIRS AND INTERVALS BETWEEN GUNS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The necessity of using guns in pairs for mutual support
in case of mechanical trouble no longer holds good. Guns
in the open have usually been placed not less than 50 yards
apart. This enables the best use to be made of the
ground as protection against artillery fire and for concealment.
In trench warfare guns should usually be
placed singly, arrangements being made for “cross fire”
and mutual support between the guns of any particular
section of the defensive line.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>OBSERVATION OF FIRE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Observation of fire has usually been obtainable up to
900 yards, and in favourable circumstances at even longer
ranges.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even when the ground has been unfavourable, observation
has often been obtainable on water, walls of
houses, enemy’s parapet, etc.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>OVERHEAD FIRE AND CONDITION OF GROUND.</h3>

<p class='c014'>During the fighting on the Marne and on the Aisne,
guns were often able to support the infantry advance
to within 100 yards of the enemy’s position.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even on flat ground frequent instances are given where
overhead fire has been used, with excellent effect, from
buildings.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the whole it would appear that not enough use is
made of this fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is a question that should be carefully studied by
all Machine Gun Officers.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>INDIRECT FIRE BY GRATICULES, LEVEL, AIMING POSTS AND OBSERVATION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>All the suggested methods have been used, and in some
cases compasses and maps as well. Effect has been
obtained in the open and on enemy’s concentrations at
long ranges, and in trench warfare on working parties,
ration parties, communications, etc., behind the enemy’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>lines. A great deal more could be done in this way if
all guns were not almost invariably placed in trenches,
instead of a proportion being placed in suitable positions
in rear, and long-range fire employed. All this points
to the fact that a Machine Gun Officer should be acquainted
with all methods of employing indirect fire, in order that
he may be in a position to make the best of any opportunities
that may occur.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>CLOSE CO-OPERATION BY MACHINE GUNS WITH THE FRONT LINES OF ATTACKING INFANTRY.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Very little information has been given on this subject,
but co-operation seems to have been very poor; but
this co-operation is made very difficult in many cases
by:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Inability of the M.G. sections to keep pace with the
attacking infantry.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The visibility of the methods employed of carrying
the gun. This leads to many casualties.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. Lack of tactical knowledge on the part of many of
the more junior M.G.Os.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Lack of definite plans as to the role of the M.Gs.
before the action commences.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two following examples serve to illustrate some
of the above:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. In a recent attack, owing to lack of any previous
understanding between M.G.Os., eight M.Gs. converged
into one small section of a captured trench. Owing to
lack of space only two of these guns were able to come
into action.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. In another instance during an attack, six guns converged
into one small house. Owing to lack of space,
etc., only two of these guns were able to come into action.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before an attack a certain M.G. Officer was told to await orders from his Commanding Officer. He was
forgotten and left behind.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this case, as soon as the Officer realized that he
had been forgotten, he should have used his own initiative.</p>

<p class='c005'>All these point to the fact that some arrangements for
concerted action should be made.</p>

<p class='c005'>N. B.—See “Guns Brigaded in Action.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>OBTAINING AMMUNITION FROM LIMBER FOR GUNS WHEN ATTACKING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>1. The usual system of using Nos. 3 and 4 as carriers
is generally adopted. Often these numbers are not
sufficient for the work. It is then necessary to borrow
men from neighbouring squadrons or companies.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The bringing up of ammunition is dangerous work;
therefore it is obviously best to avoid employing trained
gunners if unskilled men are available.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. In this manner you conserve your trained gunners
for replacing casualties.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. Pack animals can sometimes be brought close to
the firing-line when the ground is favourable, thus saving
manual labour.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. Several instances are given of confusion occurring
during an attack, owing to the limber moving without
orders. This should be guarded against.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>CHIEF MECHANICAL TROUBLES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The answer to this subject emphasizes the fact that
when well looked after, the Maxim or Vickers machine
gun is thoroughly reliable. Except in very few cases
all breakages may be said to be due to want of care.
The following are the principal troubles that have
occurred:—</p>

<h4 class='c015'>1. Broken Lock Spring.</h4>

<p class='c014'>From inquiries made it would appear that many
gunners keep their guns loaded with the lock spring
compressed during the whole period that the gun is in
the trenches. This practice will be a fruitful source of
broken lock springs. The half loading motion should be
performed, and the lock spring released. To complete
the loading when required should not take more than
one second.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>2. Bulged Barrels.</h4>

<p class='c014'>These are due to mud getting into the barrel when the
gun is being carried into the trenches, while it is being
mounted, or through striking against the parapet when in
position.</p>

<p class='c005'>Waterproof sheets or sandbags should be put round
the gun when carrying it to or from the trenches.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>3. Wet Belts.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>These can generally be kept dry by covering the box
with a waterproof sheet; the exposed part of the belt
also being covered by that part of the sheet that is hung
over the gun.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>4. Muzzle Cups (Vickers’ Gun).</h4>

<p class='c014'>The reason for most of the breakages of these cups is
that they are screwed up too tight, thus allowing for no
expansion of the metal of the barrel owing to heat. At
the same time they must not be too loosely screwed up,
as this will equally cause breakages.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>5. Stove Pipe Attachment.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Complaints are made that this bursts at the seam.
This seam can easily be riveted by the armourer sergeant.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>6. Loose Belts.</h4>

<p class='c014'>Loose belts have given trouble owing to wear.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>7. Firing Pins.</h4>

<p class='c014'>A number of firing pins have been broken.</p>

<p class='c005'>Beyond these few things mechanism troubles have been
very rare.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>USE OF PACK TRANSPORT.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Pack transport for both cavalry and infantry has been
found to be more mobile and less conspicuous than
limbered wagons. A combination of both is probably
best. In many cases, before the war, pack transport
was never used; thus when issued it was little understood.
Sufficient attention is not paid to the selection
of horses for pack work. If the horses with easy action
are selected the bad effects of undue jolting can be minimized.
Putting on pack and getting in and out of action
with it is too little practised.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE FOLLOWING COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED.</h3>

<p class='c014'>1. Canvas ammunition carriers soon wear out. These
can easily be reinforced with leather by a saddler. A
board placed underneath them with rope passed through
the brass eyelets has been found very satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>2. Jolting of the pack causes the ammunition to slip
back in the belt, leading to faults in feed. Boxes can be
lined with tin from biscuit boxes. Ammunition has been
carried in boxes that have been treated in this way for
long periods without any movement of the ammunition.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>PACKING AND CARRYING GUNS IN LIMBER.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Almost every detachment appeared to have a different
method of packing their limbers. It is advisable that
gun, tripod, etc., should be carried in the front portion,
as the rear half may have to be discarded. In many
cases boxes to hold the gun are fitted into the limber
itself with good results. Converted guns are sent in
boxes too long to fit the limber.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BREAKAGES TO LIMBER.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Perches, brakes and perch hooks have frequently
broken. It is thought that brakes are too often used
instead of horses being made to take the weight of the
limber when descending hills.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BILLETS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Most Machine Gun Officers appear to make every
endeavour to keep their men in practice, practice being
daily given whether in or out of the trenches. There
are, however, exceptions, who state that there is no time
for training. As all brigades doing trench work are
similarly situated, this points to lack of effort in those
particular cases. In very few cases is any physical
training attempted. This is one of the most important
parts of the training of any man who has to carry a heavy
weight at a rapid pace. After several days of trench
work this becomes more than ever necessary. It is suggested
that only the minimum number of men actually
required to work the guns should be kept in the trenches.
The remainder of the team should be practised daily,
and every effort should be made to keep them physically
fit. In this way each man would do only very short
periods of trench work, and would be in every way better
and more prepared for really strenuous work when required.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>TO TRAIN NEW MEN FOR GUN TEAMS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Where instruction in billets is carried out on a properly
organized system there would appear to be no difficulty
in training considerable numbers of new men. In certain
brigades, brigade machine gun courses are held under
a selected Officer; the men attending these courses are
kept out of the trenches for the duration of the course.
This would appear to be by far the most satisfactory
arrangement. Many Officers complain that as soon as
they train a reserve team it is placed in the ranks, the
men fighting as ordinary riflemen. Thus after an action
when reserve men are required to replace the casualties
in the gun team, it is generally found that many of these,
on whose training as machine gunners much time and
trouble has been spent, have been killed or wounded.
This is a mistaken policy. In conclusion:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. Trained machine gunners are too valuable to be
risked on any work except their own particular job.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. All trained reserves should be kept out of danger
as much as possible until required to replace casualties.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. At ordinary times four men per gun are ample for
work in trenches; the remainder should be kept in
reserve.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. A proper system of training should be established
in each brigade.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>PAINTING OF GUNS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>It is suggested that guns should be painted on the
rainbow smudge system, in order to make them less
conspicuous and visible.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>KEEPING OFFICERS IN PRACTICE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>It is very important that all Officers, when trained as
machine gunners, should be given opportunities of practice
and of handling a section. Thus they will be ready to
take over the section at any time, if required.</p>

successfully unites both these

<p class='c005'>Its design ensures that, from chin

<p class='c005'>It affords effective security, yet
is healthfully self-ventilating—excludes
heavy rain, yet is free
from rubber or other air-tight
fabrics—is airylight, and yet warm
